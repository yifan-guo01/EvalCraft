the quantum dynamics of photosynthesis have , quite naturally , attracted a lot of attention recently .
understanding if and how nature exploits quantum ( de)coherence would have tremendous scientific and technological impact . for
what follows , photosynthesis can be simply visualized as a two   step process : ( i ) light harvesting and ( ii ) photochemical processing .
light harvesting molecules absorb the incident photon and guide the subsequent excitation to the photosynthetic reaction center ( rc ) .
it is there where the photochemistry takes place , transforming the initial electronic excitation in a transmembrane proton pump that further drives the life   sustaining chemistry . regarding step ( i ) , quantum coherence effects in light harvesting complexes ( time scale of 1   500 fs )
have been addressed theoretically and experimentally @xcite .
we will here focus on step ( ii ) , i.e. on reaction center quantum dynamics ( time scale of 1ps   10 @xmath1s ) schematically depicted in figure [ cidnp](a ) .
photosynthetic reaction centers exhibit a cascade of electron transfer reactions , starting from a photo   excited donor   acceptor dyad pi ( chlorophyl   type molecules ) and shelving the electron further apart to quinones ( q@xmath2 , q@xmath3 ) , producing a long   lived charge   separated state driving the transmembrane proton pump . in each of those steps there is a radical   ion pair formed , further perplexing the dynamics , as radical   ion pairs ( rps ) exhibit intricate magnetic field effects @xcite .
radical   ion pairs @xcite are biomolecular ions created from the photo   excited dyad @xmath4pi .
they have two unpaired electrons ( denoted by the two dots in figure [ cidnp ] ) and any number of magnetic nuclei .
the magnetic nuclei of the donor and acceptor molecular ions couple to the ion s unpaired electron via the hyperfine interaction .
this coupling , along with several other intra   molecule magnetic interactions , leads to singlet   triplet ( s   t ) mixing , i.e. a coherent oscillation of the total electronic spin , also affected by the electrons zeeman interaction with the external magnetic field .
a spin   dependent charge recombination terminates the coherent s   t mixing and leads to the reaction products , either the original neutral dyad pi ( singlet product ) or a triplet intermediate ( @xmath5pi ) . as shown in figure [ cidnp](b ) , singlet ( triplet ) radical pairs recombine at the singlet ( triplet ) recombination rate , denoted by @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .
triplet products may close the reaction cycle by intersystem   crossing into the singlet diamagnetic ground state at a rate @xmath8 .
, of the two unpaired electrons with each   other , the magnetic nuclei and the external magnetic field .
these magnetic interactions in long   lived charge   separated states ( where the long lifetime is either due to the absence of quinones or due to the large spatial separation of secondary radical   pairs ) give rise to singlet   triplet conversion and spin   dependent recombination , further perplexing the dynamics of the whole reaction .
figure adapted from @xcite.,width=8 ]    it is apparent from figure [ cidnp ] that when the lifetime of the charge   separated states ( which increases with separation ) is long enough that magnetic   field effects ( with typical timescale of e.g. s   t mixing on the order of 0.1   1 @xmath1s ) have time to build up , radical   pair spin dynamics get convolved into the reaction center dynamics .
one aspect of this interrelation pervading a large number of photosynthetic reaction centers is chemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization [ 13   20 ] , the enhancement ( by several orders of magnitude ) of the ground state ( pi ) nuclear spin polarization resulting from the rp spin dynamics .
cidnp has emerged as a rather universal signature of spin order in photosynthetic reaction centers @xcite and its possible operational significance for photosynthesis is still an open fundamental question .
cidnp is based on nuclear spin sorting , to be shortly explained , taking place in radical   pair reactions . regarding solid   state cidnp in particular , three main mechanisms have so far been known to produce cidnp signals , the three   spin   mixing ( tsm ) @xcite , the differential decay ( dd ) and the differential relaxation ( dr ) mechanism @xcite .
the first is a coherent mechanism resulting from particular magnetic interactions within the rp , while the second is about a nuclear spin imbalance brought about by different recombination rates @xmath9 .
the last mechanism ( dr ) will not be relevant for the following discussion .
we will here demonstrate that there is yet another , completely unanticipated mechanism at work _ at the fundamental quantum dynamical level of rp reactions_. it is due to the inherent quantum measurement of the rp s spin state continuously going on in the rp as part of its very charge recombination process .
the decoherence caused by this `` internal '' quantum measurement is responsible for a new kind of nuclear spin sorting , particularly efficient at low fields , and completely unrelated to other low   field cidnp studies @xcite .
this new mechanism is ubiquitous , as it is largely independent of the particular magnetic interactions in the radical pairs , and thus opens a new venue towards exploring the biological significance of cidnp   induced spin order in natural ( earth s field ) photosynthesis . in the following
we will ( i ) briefly explain the basics of cidnp signal generation for the general reader and ( ii ) recapitulate the recent progress in understanding the fundamental quantum dynamics of radical   ion   pair reactions . combining ( i ) and
( ii ) , we will then explain the quantum measurement corrections to cidnp . before proceeding ,
we just mention a classical analog of the effect to be discussed , shown in figure [ analog ] .
we consider an ensemble of coupled pendulums oscillating in the anti   symmetric mode .
the ensemble average of the sum of their displacements is @xmath10 at all times .
however , if the `` environment '' perturbs the system , e.g. with random kicks , while the ensemble population decays we will observe a non   zero total displacement rising to a maximum and decaying to zero , following suit with the population decay .
this displacement is the analog of the radical   pair nuclear spin to be discussed in the following .
the non   zero value of the nuclear spin stems from the particular `` environment '' pertaining to radical   pairs , singlet   triplet dephasing , which produces a nuclear spin imbalance along the reaction .
coupled pendulums oscillating out of phase ( anti   symmetric mode ) .
the number of such systems @xmath11 is a decaying function of time .
while they oscillate , the pendulums are perturbed by the `` environment '' , which is here assumed to produce dephasing kicks at random times .
( b ) for the particular stochastic simulation shown here , every kick from the environment was taken to initialize the amplitude of pendulum 1 to unity and of pendulum 2 to zero . in the absence of the perturbation
, all coupled pendulums would be continuously oscillating out of phase , and the ensemble average of the sum of their displacements away from equilibrium , @xmath12 , would be constantly zero . in the presence of the dephasing kicks , however , a non   zero displacement is shown to build up , to later on decay to zero due to the total population decay.,width=8 ]
consider radical   ion pairs with just one nucleus coupled to the electron of e.g. the donor . at time @xmath13 the radical   ion pairs start out in the electronic singlet state , while the nuclear spins are thermally polarized , which for protons at earth s field corresponds to a polarization of about @xmath14 , practically taken to equal zero .
thus , in the ensemble of radical   ion pairs half will have the nuclear spin in the @xmath15 state , while in the other half the nuclear spin will initially be in the @xmath16 state .
the local magnetic field seen by the donor electron will be the external field plus the nuclear magnetic field , while the acceptor electron will only experience the external magnetic field .
it is this difference in local magnetic fields experienced by the two electrons that results in a difference in their larmor frequencies , and hence induces the coherent singlet   triplet conversion .
consequently , in the first half radical pairs ( with a @xmath15 nuclear spin ) the larmor precession frequency of the donor electron , and thus the s   t mixing frequency , will be slightly higher than in the other half ( due to the opposite contribution of the nuclear spin ) , hence the coherently formed triplet radical pairs will have their nuclear spins predominantly in the @xmath15 state , leaving the singlet radical pairs with an opposite nuclear polarization . while the nuclear spins are thus sorted among singlet and triplet rps , and unless there is a coherent mechanism like tsm producing net nuclear polarization , the expectation value @xmath17 of the z   component of the single nuclear spin under consideration is still zero . here @xmath18 is the spin density matrix of the radical pair , describing the electron and nuclear spin degrees of freedom altogether , and @xmath19 is the direction of the external magnetic field .
according to the traditional understanding of the radical   pair mechanism and the concomitant cidnp signal generation , for this nuclear spin sorting to result in a diamagnetic ground state with net nuclear polarization , and in the absence of any coherent mechanism like tsm , the differential decay mechanism ( dd ) should be at play in order to observe nonzero cidnp signals . in the following
we will indeed consider a magnetic hamiltonian that _ does not _ exhibit the tsm mechanism , and we will also take @xmath20 , so that the dd mechanism is not operational . hence according to the traditional theory of rp spin dynamics
, no cidnp signal should be expected .
we are then going to show that the opposite is actually true .      to illustrate the above considerations
, we consider a radical pair with one spin 1/2 nucleus _ isotropically _ coupled to the donor electron . in figure [ traces](a )
we display the undisturbed spin state evolution brought about _ just _ by the magnetic hamiltonian @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the electron spin larmor precession frequency in the external magnetic field defining the z   axis and @xmath23 the donor   electron hyperfine coupling with the donor nuclear spin ( in units of frequency ) .
what is plotted in figure [ traces](a ) is the spin state s singlet character , given by the expectation value of the singlet projection operator , @xmath24 , and assuming an rp with infinite lifetime ( in other words so far we take the recombination rates to be @xmath25 ) .
what figure [ traces](a ) displays are the singlet   triplet oscillations brought about by @xmath26 .
the nuclear spin , @xmath27 , of singlet and triplet rps is given by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , and displayed in figure [ traces](b ) .
the previous considerations regarding nuclear spin sorting are easily visualized by noting in figure [ traces](b ) that although @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the nuclear spin oscillations in the singlet and triplet subspace are exactly out of phase , so the net rp nuclear polarization @xmath32 . in case
it is not obvious , we prove that @xmath33 in appendix 1 .
we can also show formally that for this particular hamiltonian @xmath26 it will be @xmath34 , as expected since @xmath26 does not qualify for the tsm mechanism @xcite .
the proof can be found in appendix 2 .     and ( b ) the nuclear spin of singlet rps @xmath28 ( green line ) and the nuclear spin of triplet rps @xmath29 ( pink line ) , when the radical   pair spin state undergoes unceasing coherent s   t mixing driven by @xmath35 $ ] , where @xmath21 .
for this particular example it was @xmath36 .
the nuclear spin of singlet rps is exactly out of phase with the nuclear spin of triplet rps , so that their sum @xmath37.,width=8 ]      now , besides the coherent rp dynamics producing the oscillations in figure [ traces ] , which are driven by @xmath35 $ ] as discussed in the previous paragraph , the spin   selective charge recombination of rps has to be accounted for .
this is done by a master equation of the form @xmath35+{\cal l}(\rho)$ ] , where @xmath38 is the reaction super   operator , written in terms of the singlet and triplet projection operators , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and the singlet and triplet recombination rates , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .
recently , quantum measurement theory has been shown @xcite to fundamentally describe the reaction dynamics of rps , resulting in a new form of @xmath38 , conceptually departing from the traditional theory used until now @xcite .
the main physical point of departure is the fact that the very charge recombination process of rps damps their coherent s   t mixing , i.e. it brings about an unavoidable intra   molecule decoherence in their spin state evolution .
the traditional theory for the reaction operator of rps , although successful in accounting for a large volume of experimental data , does not embody this decoherence process , neglecting which leads to several conceptual problems @xcite . in any case ,
in the example treated above , if the nuclear spin expectation value is evaluated according to the full master equation of the traditional theory , taking @xmath20 , it is found to be identically equal to zero , exactly as it is if only the hamiltonian evolution is taken into account .
this is formally shown in appendix 3 . according to the common wisdom ,
this should be perceived as an obvious result , since , with @xmath20 the differential decay mechanism ( dd ) can not lead to any net nuclear polarization . to recapitulate , the statement that @xmath34 at all times when considering _ just _ the hamiltonian evolution remains true _ according to the traditional master equation of spin chemistry _ , that is , if we _ also _ take into account the recombination reaction which gradually diminishes the radical   pair population to zero .
the counter   intuitive new result presented here is this : according to the new master equation describing the fundamental quantum dynamics of rp reactions @xcite , there actually is a non   zero rp nuclear spin polarization , depicted in figure [ result ] .
a similar result , different by just a factor of 2 , follows from another variant of the quantum   measurement   based stochastic liouville equation @xcite . in this particular example
, this nuclear polarization is about @xmath0 times higher than the thermal equilibrium proton polarization ( left y   axis of figure [ result ] ) and roughly independent of @xmath22 as long as @xmath22 is relatively small ( to be further discussed later ) .
what is the source of this new kind of cidnp signal
? we will now go beyond the particular example considered above and provide the explanation for the general case of this new channel for photochemically enhancing nuclear polarizations _ at earth s field _ : the fundamental singlet   triplet decoherence underlying the radical   pair mechanism .     according to the full density matrix equation of kominis @xcite , with @xmath41 .
the absolute value of the nuclear polarization is shown in the right y   axis , while its enhancement relative to the thermal equilibrium polarization , on the order of @xmath0 , is shown in the left y   axis .
qualitatively the same result ( only higher by about a factor of 2 ) is obtained from the jones   hore theory @xcite . in contrast , the traditional theory predicts @xmath34 , exactly the same as the sum of the two traces in figure [ traces](b ) that applies to the case of no recombination reaction . note the different time scales in this figure from figure [ traces ] : since @xmath42 , the build   up of @xmath43 in this plot takes place at the very beginning of the s   t mixing oscillations shown in figures [ traces](a ) and [ traces](b).,width=8 ]    to visualize this mechanism , suppose that at time @xmath44 the single   nuclear   spin rp ensemble is described by the density matrix @xmath18 . assuming a magnetic hamiltonian _ not _ supporting any coherent generation of _ net _ rp nuclear polarization , as in the example considered previously
, it will be @xmath45 .
this , as already mentioned , implies that @xmath46 .
the idea behind the new kind of cidnp signal generation is the following .
the intramolecule s   t decoherence is equivalent to some rps being _ projected _ to either the singlet or the triplet rp manifold of states , exactly due to the continuous quantum measurement of @xmath47 induced by the rp recombination dynamics , the measurement rate being @xmath48 @xcite .
the result of this measurement is either @xmath49 , i.e. the rp is projected to the singlet manifold , or @xmath50 , i.e. the rp is projected to the triplet manifold .
the probability for a singlet or a triplet projection is @xmath51 or @xmath52 , respectively .
hence , at time @xmath53 the state of the radical   pairs will be ( ignoring the rps that recombine into neutral products during @xmath54 ) a new mixture comprised of ( a ) radical pairs in the state @xmath55 , with @xmath56 $ ] , plus ( b ) the singlet   projected radical pairs described by @xmath57 , plus ( c ) triplet   projected radical pairs described by @xmath58 .
the nuclear polarization of states ( a ) will still be zero , since again , the hamiltonian @xmath26 does not generate _ net _ nuclear polarization .
the combined nuclear polarization of projected states ( b ) and ( c ) , denoted by @xmath59 , will be the _ weighted _ sum of singlet rp nuclear polarization , @xmath60 , and triplet rp nuclear polarization , @xmath61 , the sum being weighted by the respective projection probabilities , i.e. @xmath62 taking into account that @xmath63 and using the completeness relation @xmath64 , it follows that @xmath65 thus , if @xmath66 , more ( when @xmath67 ) or less ( when @xmath68 ) projections will take place to the singlet state than to the triplet , and @xmath69 will be non   zero , if of course @xmath60 is non   zero .    to recapitulate the physics of this new effect , the singlet   triplet dephasing inherent in the radical   pair quantum dynamic evolution randomly projects radical   pairs into either the singlet or the triplet subspace . the projection probability at time @xmath44 depends on the singlet ( or triplet ) character of the electronic spin state , hence the projections will be asymmetric if @xmath70 .
nuclear spin sorting , i.e. the fact that @xmath71 , combined with the asymmetric projections produces a non   zero nuclear spin expectation value .
we can now theoretically estimate the quantum measurement corrections to cidnp , to be denoted by @xmath43 , shown in figure [ result ] . letting @xmath72 ,
the rate of singlet or triplet projections ( the `` quantum measurement '' rate ) is just @xmath73 .
we will focus on low magnetic fields and assume , as is the case most often , that @xmath74 . towards the estimate , consider the following three steps : ( 1 ) as the rps start out in the singlet state , and the s   t mixing frequency @xmath75 , in the short reaction time of @xmath76 the singlet character will not have enough time to change appreciably , so it will be @xmath77 .
this means that the rps will be projected predominantly to the singlet state .
( 2 ) the electron spin of the donor molecule , which contains the one and only nuclear spin of the rp under consideration , will precess at frequency @xmath78 when the nuclear spin is in the @xmath79 state . so at time @xmath44 , the number of singlet rps with the nuclear spin in the @xmath79 state will be @xmath80 ^ 2 $ ] .
the nuclear polarization of singlet rps at time @xmath81 will thus be @xmath82 , easily seen to be @xmath83 and ( 3 ) , s   t projections taking place at the rate @xmath84 will be a source term for @xmath85 .
the source term , proportional to @xmath59 , starts at @xmath13 from zero and oscillates at a rate @xmath86 while it is drained at a rate @xmath84 , thus @xmath87 , yielding at time @xmath88 that @xmath89 . putting everything together and using equation ( [ eq : izpr ] ) ,
we finally arrive at @xmath90 for the particular example depicted in figure [ traces ] it is @xmath91 , hence according to the estimate of equation ( [ estm ] ) it is @xmath92 , in good agreement with the exact value shown in the right y   axis of figure [ result ] .
furthermore , the result of equation ( [ estm ] ) can be recast in terms of the thermal polarization @xmath93 ( the expression for @xmath94 is valid for @xmath95 ) , where @xmath96 is the electron larmor frequency in the external magnetic field @xmath97 , with @xmath98 2.8mhz / g being the electron gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath99 is the ratio of electron   to   proton magnetic moment .
the enhancement factor @xmath100 is thus seen to be independent of @xmath22 and equal to @xmath101 for ease of use , in the previous expression we provided the enhancement factor in terms of the s   t mixing frequency @xmath86 ( in units of @xmath102 ) , the hyperfine coupling @xmath23 ( in units of @xmath103 ) and the recombination rate @xmath84 ( in units of @xmath104 ) . for typical hyperfine couplings of about 10 gauss and recombination times on the order of 1 ns , it is seen that the quantum measurement corrections to chemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization amount to a significant enhancement of at least four orders of magnitude over the thermal polarization .
we note for the reader who would worry about angular momentum conservation that the rp s nuclear spin polarization is exactly balanced by an opposite and equal electronic spin polarization , i.e. the sum @xmath105 at all times , as it should be , since it is zero at time @xmath13 ( the initial state is @xmath106 , which is a singlet state with zero nuclear polarization ) .
the non   zero electronic spin polarization necessarily involves the admixture of the @xmath107 and @xmath108 triplet states , therefore this new cidnp mechanism is a low   magnetic   field effect , because at high fields the @xmath109 states are out of reach from the singlet state @xmath110 .
how low a magnetic field depends on the recombination rate @xmath84 , since the triplet rp decay broadens the triplet energy levels by about @xmath84 , hence the mechanism is appreciable for magnetic fields @xmath97 such that @xmath111 , i.e. when the zeeman energy separation of @xmath109 is within the broadening @xmath84 . for @xmath112 , the effect is appreciable for fields @xmath113 .
in closing , the following comments should be made : we stress that the new cidnp signal is a fundamental phenomenon attributed to the inherent quantum dynamics of radical   ion pairs .
kaptein s rules provide a compact relation of the main features of the cidnp signal to the system s parameters . for this case , the sign of the effect , i.e. whether it is emissive ( + ) or absorptive (   ) is the same as the sign of the hyperfine coupling @xmath23 . the new cidnp effect reported here
does not require any particular combination or fine   tuning of magnetic interactions , like the coherent tsm low   field effect analyzed in @xcite , but is rather general and shows up whenever there is a non   zero nuclear spin polarization of singlet rps , @xmath60 , as in figure [ traces](b ) .
the rather general requirement for this to happen is that the oscillation frequencies @xmath114 of the non   zero matrix elements @xmath115_{mn}=\langle m|q_{s}|n\rangle$ ] must have terms linear in the hyperfine couplings . here
@xmath116 and @xmath117 are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath26 , with @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the nuclear spin multiplicity of the radical   pair . regarding experimental detection of the new cidnp effect we note the following .
while nmr measurements at low fields suffer loss of sensitivity , recent methods of ultra   sensitive magnetometry using squids @xcite or atomic magnetometers @xcite have demonstrated the ability to sensitively detect nmr signals at near   zero magnetic fields . to provide a rough estimate of the magnetic field @xmath120 produced by the polarized nuclear spins
, we note that in the solid phase the concentration of reaction centers can be as large as 1  mm . assuming just a single proton spin per rc ( which will heavily underestimate the magnitude of the effect ) , choosing a magnetic field of 1 g and taking into account that the considered enhancement will boost the thermal nuclear polarization by a factor @xmath0 , we find that the magnetic field just outside a spherical volume will be @xmath121 $ ] where @xmath122 $ ] is the reaction center concentration . at 1 g
the thermal polarization is @xmath123 , hence @xmath124 , already 200 times higher than what state   of   the   art atomic magnetometers can do @xcite .
in fact , this seems to be yet another exciting application of ultra   sensitive magnetometry in the biological realm @xcite .
although we considered the special case @xmath20 , the new kind of cidnp signal we predict will ubiquitously affect all sorts of radical pairs , including of course the ones with asymmetric recombination rates @xmath9 , which predominantly occur in photosynthetic reaction centers @xcite .
we have chosen to deal with the special case @xmath20 and a magnetic hamiltonian unable to support coherent generation of cidnp signals in order to be able to focus exclusively on this fundamentally new cidnp process .
establishing how this mechanism attributed to s   t decoherence affects , qualitatively and quantitatively , the cases where _ there exists _ a cidnp signal according to the mechanism s traditional understanding ( e.g tsm , dd or dr scenarios ) is more involved an exercise that will be undertaken elsewhere .
we have considered the cidnp signal in the rp state , and not in the diamagnetic ground state of the molecule in a closed reaction cycle as the one shown in figure [ cidnp](b ) .
in other words in figure [ result ] we depicted the transient nuclear polarization of the radical   ion pairs in between their creation at time @xmath13 and the time their population has decayed to zero due to charge recombination .
however , it is easily seen that the same results hold true for the diamagnetic ground state in the steady state under continuous excitation ( i.e. continuous illumination ) and a closed reaction cycle , as long as the intersystem crossing rate @xmath8 ( see figure [ cidnp]b ) is fast enough .    concluding , this is the first step of a very promising research program , namely what are the particular repercussions of the recently unraveled fundamental quantum dynamics of the radical pair mechanism for understanding the dynamics of photosynthetic reaction centers .
we have extended the fundamental understanding of cidnp by pointing to a new and qualitatively different way to obtaining enhanced nuclear spin polarization . interestingly , this polarization _ naturally _ turns out to be significant at low magnetic fields pertinent to natural photosynthesis .
it stems from the random singlet or triplet projections _ naturally _ taking place during the quantum evolution of radical pairs and leading to spin decoherence .
thus , an intriguing question raised is if and how the quantum mechanical process of spin decoherence affects the biological workings of photosynthetic reaction centers . in other words ,
what is the biological significance of earth   field cidnp produced by s   t decoherence ?
since @xmath125 commutes with the electron spins @xmath126 and @xmath127 , it also commutes with @xmath128 and with @xmath129 .
thus , since the two projection operators are orthogonal , i.e. @xmath130 , it will be @xmath131 .
furthermore , since @xmath132 , it will be @xmath133 , and by using the previous relations it follows that indeed @xmath33 .
since @xmath125 commutes with @xmath126 and @xmath134=ii_{y } , [ i_{z},i_{y}]= ii_{x}$ ] , it follows that @xmath135=ia(s_{1x}i_{y} s_{1y}i_{x})$ ] .
then , heisenberg s equation of motion @xmath136 $ ] leads to @xmath137 the most general pure spin state of the rp can be written as @xmath138 , where @xmath139 are the four electron   spin s   t basis states and @xmath140 is a nuclear spin state .
it is straightforward to show that @xmath141 , therefore @xmath142 at all times .
the same holds true for any mixture of pure states . since at time
@xmath13 we have an rp mixture with zero nuclear polarization , at all times it will be @xmath143\rangle=0 $ ] .
the traditional master equation is @xmath35 k_{s}(q_{s}\rho+\rho q_{s})/2 k_{t}(q_{t}\rho+\rho q_{t})/2 $ ] . for the case under study
@xmath144 , and taking into account that @xmath132 , the traditional master equation becomes @xmath35 k\rho$ ] .
after multiplying with @xmath125 and taking the trace , it follows that according to the traditional theory it will be @xmath145i_{z}\} k\langle i_{z}\rangle$ ] . but @xmath146i_{z}\}= \tr\{[{\cal h},i_{z}]\rho\}= \langle[{\cal h},i_{z}]\rangle$ ] , which was shown to equal zero in appendix 2 . therefore @xmath147 .
since at @xmath13 it is @xmath34 , the same is true at all times .

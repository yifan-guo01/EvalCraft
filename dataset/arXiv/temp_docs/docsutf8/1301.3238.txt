evolutionary game theory ( egt ) is becoming a general theoretical framework to analysis strategies behaviors @xcite .
egt is rooted in the classical game theory ( cgt ) @xcite and the theory of evolution @xcite .
different from cgt , egt predicts there could exist persistent cycles in the evolutionary trajectories in the strategy space @xcite .    as an example
let us consider the standard rock   paper   scissors ( rps ) game .
this is a prototype game in textbooks @xcite . in this game ,
dynamics equations ( e.g. , the standard replicator dynamics equations ) in egt predict that the evolutionary trajectory will cycle around the nash equilibrium persistently .
however , the cgt predicts full random behavior : the system is in a mixed   strategy equilibrium with each cyclic motion being balanced completely by its reverse cyclic motion . according to the cgt theory , cycles ( also referred to as excess loops )
can not be observed in the evolutionary trajectories in the long run  @xcite .
empirical examples of the rps cycles are constantly being discovered in nature , e.g. , three morphs male lizard  @xcite and others @xcite . the environment for animal contests is decentralized , in which the encounter is pairwise , but population strategy shows cyclic behaviors @xcite . in general , human economic behaviors ( e.g. , exchanges ) are also pairwise and not centralized @xcite .
to test egt in human game experiments  @xcite , the traditional setting is decentralized ( see review  @xcite ) , in which a subject in each round competes with one random   pairwise opponent within a finite population @xcite . in such traditional setting experiment , whether the trajectories are persistent cycles instead of convergence to a nash equilibrium remains an open question  @xcite .
till now , no persistent cycle has been confirmed in the rps experiment under such a traditional setting @xcite , and furthermore no dynamics observation has been reported quantitatively .    in this paper
we study the evolutionary trajectories of the rock   paper   scissors game from the perspective of non   equilibrium statistical physics . in non   equilibrium statistical physics studies , formulating a physically meaningful measure of the distance from equilibrium is an area of active research  @xcite .
an equilibrium system satisfies the detailed balance condition , which ensures the time reversal symmetry . however , detailed balance is broken in a non   equilibrium system even in its stationary state , therefore various dynamical patterns may show up in the evolutionary trajectory .
several non   equilibrium order parameters , such as entropy production  @xcite and velocity  @xcite , have been constructed to characterize the distance from equilibrium . in this work
we carry out laboratory experiments on the rps game , and we detect the possible existence of persistent cyclic flows using an angular frequency as the non   equilibrium order parameter .
a non   zero angular frequency serves as a quantitative measure of the distance from equilibrium for the evolutionary trajectories .
we also compare our experimental observations with the predictions of a simple non   equilibrium model , the discrete   time logit dynamical process with a noise parameter @xmath2 .
our experiments are the standard rps games with the experimental setting of discrete time , random pairwise matching and local information .
this setting has its reality in biology and economics @xcite .
we collect a total number of twelve experimental trajectories from our experiments ( each trajectory is the result of @xmath3 rounds of the game ) and then analyze these trajectories . like other previous experiments @xcite and theories @xcite ,
the evolutionary trajectories are highly stochastic , but using our non   equilibrium order parameter we are able to confirm that cycles exist and do not dissipate .
the mean frequency of cycles is about @xmath1 period per experimental round .
this mean value is used to evaluate the noise parameter @xmath2 of the logit dynamics model , and a value of @xmath4 is obtained .
this paper is organized as following . in the next section
we introduce the standard rps game in the traditional setting and describe our data analysis protocol . in section [ sec : results ] we describe our main experimental results .
the experimental results are compared with the predictions of the discrete   time logit dynamics model in section [ sec : model ] .
we conclude this work in the last section .
there are three different pure strategies in the rock   paper   scissors game , namely rock ( @xmath5 ) , paper ( @xmath5 ) and scissors ( @xmath6 ) .
these three strategies form a directed circle @xmath7 , namely @xmath5 beats @xmath6 , @xmath6 beats @xmath8 , and @xmath8 in turn beats @xmath5 . in our experiments we use the simple payoff matrix shown in table  [ rpspaoffmatrix ] to make the rps game a constant   sum game
: in each play between two players , the winning player gets a payoff @xmath9 ( i.e. , two experimental points ) while the losing player gets a payoff @xmath10 ; if there is a tie then each player gets an equal payoff @xmath11 .
.[rpspaoffmatrix ] payoff matrix of the rock   paper   scissors game .
the value of each matrix element is the payoff of the row player s strategy given the strategy of the column player . [
cols="^,^,^,^ " , ]     the last four rows are the statistical results of the @xmath12 experimental groups above . the row titled as @xmath13 value is @xmath14 test result by setting the null hypothesis @xmath15 for the @xmath12 samples .
95%u(l ) means the upper ( lower ) bound of @xmath16 confidence interval over the @xmath12 samples .
to theoretically understand the experimental observations , we now study a noisy best   response process as a simple model for the rps game , namely the discrete   time logit dynamics @xcite .
multiple equilibria and limit cycles in the logit dynamics has also been studied in a very recent paper by hommes and ochea @xcite in the continuous   time limit .
suppose the population of @xmath17 players is in the social state @xmath18 after the @xmath14 th round of the game .
let us denote by @xmath19 the mean payoff of the strategy @xmath20 for this social state . from the payoff matrix of table [ rpspaoffmatrix ]
we can easily obtain that @xmath21 we assume that at the @xmath22 round of the game , each player of the population will choose a strategy from @xmath23 independently of all the other players . and
we further assume that the time   dependent probability @xmath24 for a player to choose strategy @xmath25 is @xmath26 the parameter @xmath2 is referred to as the  inverse temperature " of the logit dynamics , its value quantifies the rationality degree of human agents in strategy interaction @xcite . in the limiting case of @xmath27
each strategy will be chosen with the uniform probability @xmath28 .
for this simple markovian process , the transition probability @xmath29 from a social state @xmath18 at time @xmath14 to another social state @xmath30 at time @xmath22 is expressed as ( noticing that @xmath31 ) @xmath32 } } { ( e^ { \beta ( x + 2 z ) } + e^{\beta ( y + 2 x)}+ e^{\beta ( z + 2 y ) } ) ^n } \ ; . \label{eq : transition}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the steady   state probability @xmath33 that the system is in the social state @xmath18 at @xmath34 can be obtained by solving the following fixed   point equation @xmath35 because the transition probability from any social state @xmath18 to any another social state @xmath30 is positive , eq .
( [ eq : fixedpoint ] ) has a unique solution with the normalization property @xmath36 @xcite .
it is not difficult to prove that the steady   state probability distribution has the following rotational symmetry @xmath37 this rotational symmetry ensures that @xmath38 namely the logit dynamics will reach the nash equilibrium @xmath39 at @xmath40 .
it can be checked numerically and analytically that , for any @xmath41 , the detailed balance condition is violated at the steady   state of the logit dynamics . for two different social states
@xmath42 and @xmath30 , in general we will find that @xmath43 because of the violation of detailed balance , directional flows may persist in the system even at @xmath40 .     the steady   state mean cycling frequency @xmath44 of the discrete   time logit dynamical process with population size @xmath0 .
the solid line is theoretical result obtained with eq .
( [ def : freq   theta ] ) ; the cross ( @xmath45 ) symbols with error bars are obtained by averaging over many simulated evolutionary trajectories of length @xmath3 .
the mean experimental frequency of @xmath46 and its @xmath16 confidence upper and lower bound are marked by the dashed lines . ]    we are especially interested in the directional flow around the nash equilibrium point .
consider two social states @xmath18 and @xmath30 on the evolutionary trajectory at two consecutive time points @xmath14 and @xmath47 . if either @xmath18 or @xmath30 is identical to the nash equilibrium point , the transition @xmath48 is _ not _ a rotational motion around the nash equilibrium , and we set the corresponding rotational angle @xmath49 to be zero .
the nash equilibrium point may be sitting on the rectilinear line that passing through the social states @xmath18 and @xmath50 .
if this is the case , the transition @xmath51 is also _ not _ a rotational motion around the nash equilibrium , and its rotational angle @xmath49 is again set to be zero . in all the remaining cases , the social states @xmath18 , @xmath30 and the nash equilibrium point form a triangle in the social state plane of fig .
[ fig:28state ] .
the magnitude of the rotational angle @xmath49 is just the angle of this triangle at vertex point @xmath52 , it must be less than @xmath53 .
the rotational angle @xmath49 is defined as positive if the rotation from @xmath18 to @xmath54 with respect to the nash equilibrium point is counter   clockwise , otherwise it is defined as negative .    at the steady   state of the discrete   time logit dynamics ,
the mean frequency @xmath44 that the evolution trajectory rotates around the nash equilibrium point can then be computed by the following formula @xmath55     probability of staying in the social state @xmath42 for a population of size @xmath0 .
the horizontal axis is the predicted probability by the discrete   time logit dynamics model with inverse temperature @xmath56 , while the vertical axis is the empirical probability measured from the @xmath12 experimental trajectories . because of
the rotational symmetry ( [ eq : rotation ] ) , the @xmath57 social states can be coarse   grained into ten groups : ( 1 ) , @xmath58 ; ( 2 ) , @xmath59 ; ( 3 ) , @xmath60 ; ( 4 ) , @xmath61 ; ( 5 ) , @xmath62 ; ( 6 ) , @xmath63 ; ( 7 ) , @xmath64 ; ( 8) , @xmath65 ; ( 9 ) , @xmath66 ; ( 10 ) , @xmath67 .
all the social states of a given group have the same stationary probability ( the same horizontal   axis value ) according to the theoretical model , but their measured probabilities might be different ( the mean vertical   axis value and the standard error ) . ]    for the population size @xmath0 , we show in fig .  [
fig : anglen6 ]
the steady   state mean frequency @xmath44 as a function of the inverse temperature @xmath2 . to check the correctness of the theoretical calculations
, we also perform computer simulations based on the discrete   time logit dynamics model to generate a set of simulated evolutionary trajectories of length @xmath3 .
the mean cycling frequencies of these simulated evolutionary trajectories are also shown in fig .
[ fig : anglen6 ] . the agreement between analytical calculations and computer simulation results
are very good .
we find that @xmath44 increases almost linearly with the inverse temperature @xmath2 when @xmath68 .
comparing the theoretical results with the mean frequency value of @xmath69 , we infer the inverse parameter should be set to @xmath56 .    at @xmath56
, we also perform computer simulations based on the discrete   time logic dynamics model to generate a set of independent evolution trajectories of length @xmath70 .
we then perform the same analysis on these trajectories and find that the direction of the cycles is counter   clockwise and the mean cycling frequency is @xmath71 , consistent with the experimental result .    at @xmath72 , the steady   state probability @xmath33 of visiting each social state @xmath18 as predicted by the logit dynamics
is compared with the empirically observed probability of visiting @xmath18 , see fig .
[ fig : wvalues ] .
the agreement between theory and experiment is again very good .
although the discrete   time noisy   response logit dynamic model can describe our experimental observations excellently , we should point out an important difference between the model assumption and the experimental setting . in our experiments , after each round of the game , each player only knows the strategy of her / his opponent but not the social state of the whole population .
however in the logit dynamics model , we assume that each player choose a strategy based on the knowledge of the current social state of the population , see eq .
( [ logitdyn ] ) . in this sense ,
the logit dynamics model is still a phenomenological model .
it is of interest to quantitatively describe the rps evolutionary dynamics by a more microscopic model .
we hope to return to this issue in a future study .
as a brief summary , in this work we studied the rock   paper   scissors game both experimentally and analytically .
our experimental data gave strong evidence that counter   clockwise cycles around the nash equilibrium point exist in the social   state evolutionary trajectory of a finte population .
we demonstrated that our experimental observations can be quantitatively understood by a simple theoretical model of noisy   response logit dynamics .
rps game experiments on egt were also reported quite recently by cason and co   authors and by hoffman and co   authors @xcite .
the backgrounds and cutting edges of the experiment research are well documented in these two references @xcite .
compared with the decentralized setting of our present work , the experimental environments of the rps game in these two recent works @xcite are all centralized : instead of pairwise meetings , in all of the experiments reported in @xcite , each subject competes against the choices of all other subjects .
however , the decentralized setting ( especially the random matching pairwise setting ) is more closer to the natural environments in biology and economics ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .
for example , the encounters of male lizards are pairwise meetings  @xcite . for decentralized population
rps games , according to our knowledge , the existence of persistent cyclic motions was not confirmed by any previous laboratory experiments .
going back to traditional ( decentralized ) setting experiments of the simplest rps game , the present work added strong evidence in favor of the existence of persistent cycles . as a fundamental observation on cycle , the mean frequency of cycles was quantitatively meassured .
there are tens of dynamics models which have been build to interpret cyclic behavior in rps game , however there are rare quantitative observations from real experiments .
quantitative measurements from experiments is important , without which to evaluate a dynamics equation precisely is almost impossible ( or plausible ) .
as demonstrated , our experimental observations can be quantitatively understood by a simple theoretical model of noisy   response logit dynamics .
we wish to emphasize two major points of our experimental approach .
first , by recording sufficiently long evolutionary trajectories , we were able to detect weak deterministic motion in a highly stochastic process .
we noticed that cycles can only be confirmed ( @xmath73 ) when the trajectories are longer than @xmath74 rounds in twelve samples .
second , we focus on time asymmetry of social state transitions .
importance of time asymmetry has been well emphasised in non   equilibrium statistical physics  @xcite .
the frequency is observed from the loops out of detailed balance .

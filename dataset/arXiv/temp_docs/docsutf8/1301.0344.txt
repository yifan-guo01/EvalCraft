the advent of novel video services with multiple views of the same video scene , e.g. , 3 d tv or free   view point video , poses many novel challenges in terms of coding , processing and transmission of the multimedia content .
as far as encoding techniques are concerned , the iso / itu   t joint video team has recently finalized the h.264 multiview video coding ( mvc ) standard , which is explicitly devoted to efficient compression of a multiview source @xcite .
it is expected that multiview video communication services will be traffic intensive , which raises important questions in network dimensioning .
in addition , the encoding dependencies between the different views renders resource allocation quite challenging in a mvc communication system .
both problems of network dimensioning and resource allocation are usually addressed with the help of traffic models in classical video delivery services .
such tools have proved to be a valid support for efficient and accurate allocation of network resources by characterizing the compressed video content through statistical models .
video traffic models have been derived for different applications in teleconferencing @xcite , video broadcasting @xcite , or streaming @xcite .
different stochastic models based on autoregressive processes @xcite , transform expanded sample ( tes ) processes @xcite , and hidden markov models ( hmms ) @xcite have been considered for network design , resource allocation , buffer dimensioning , and performance evaluation @xcite .
there is however a lack of traffic models for multiview video communication services .
we propose here a new traffic model for mvc content in order to characterize the frame size sequence observed at the output of an mvc variable bit rate ( vbr ) source .
specifically , building on our preliminary work @xcite , we design a doubly stochastic source model , namely a poisson hidden markov model ( p   hmm ) @xcite , in which the first ( hidden ) layer consists of a non   stationary chain modeling the video activity level and the second layer represents the frame sizes of the different mvc encoded views . besides , we extend the p   hmm parameter estimation algorithm for short observation sequences presented in @xcite and adapt it to long sequences such as those encountered in video communication services .
we assess the model performances by extensive numerical simulations on classes of mvc sequences sharing common properties .
we apply our model to predict the traffic load generated by two different network services based on a client   server video communication paradigm . in the first one , that we name multiview tv
, the server simultaneously streams all the mvc encoded views to the client .
our model is shown to be able to predict the state of sender and receiver buffers in multiview tv . in the second one ,
named interactive tv , the client dynamically selects the views during the streaming session by means of a feedback channel .
due to the mvc encoding dependencies , the server transmits a composite stream encompassing all encoded data required to correctly decode the selected view .
finally , we introduce an interactive tv user service request model , in order to mimic the sequence of requested views selected by the user .
in fact , the traffic generated during the interactive tv session depends both on the mvc encoded video traces and on the user s view selection .
we show that the combination of our two models is able to accurately characterize the traffic in interactive multiview applications .
the main contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows :    * a non   stationary traffic model for vbr mvc sequences is introduced , with the ability to characterize different classes of mvc streams at different encoding settings .
the model can predict actual network load in network applications ; * a maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimation procedure suitable to derive the traffic model parameters in long sequences is derived ; * a user behavior model for interactive view selection is combined with our traffic model to characterize interactive multiview traffic .
the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : phmm ] , we introduce the poisson hidden markov model ( p   hmm ) and discuss its feasibility ; we also describe the p   hmm parameter set estimation procedure . in section [ sec : mas ] , we validate the model in different stream settings .
network applications of our model are studied in section [ sec : buf ] , along with the view switching model .
section [ sec : conc ] concludes the paper .
a mvc stream jointly encodes different video sequences captured by multiple cameras with overlapping fields of view .
let us denote by @xmath0 the number of such sequences .
one view , denoted as reference view , is independently encoded using temporal motion compensation and transform coding techniques , similarly to a classical video sequence encoded with the h.264 encoder @xcite .
the other @xmath1 views are encoded using inter   view prediction in addiction to temporal prediction , in order to further improve the compression performance . in h.264 mvc @xcite , inter   view prediction is allowed between frames referring to the same time instant , whereas intra   view encoding dependencies are usually set to permit temporal scalability @xcite .
the encoding dependencies give rise to a generalized groups of pictures ( gop ) structure of duration @xmath2 , constituted by @xmath3 frames .
figures [ fig : gop8 ] and [ fig : gop4 ] show two examples of such mvc gops . given the complete mvc encoded bitstream ,
up to @xmath0 flows are transmitted and decoded by the client . in most applications ,
all the views are transmitted together in a simulcast mode .
gop structure and encoding hierarchy ( @xmath4 ) . ]    gop structure and encoding hierarchy ( @xmath5 ) . ]    in order to control the size of the bitstreams , different rate control algorithms @xcite can be implemented in mvc encoders .
we however focus in this paper on variable bit rate ( vbr ) streams , where the quantization step sizes are fixed .
their value only depends on the frame type , as commonly employed in most mvc applications @xcite .
we propose now a new model that is able to characterize the frame sizes in gops of an mvc compressed stream with a given gop structure . in vbr operating mode , the bit   rate of the mvc encoded views varies according to the video activity level , and the traffic model should match this non stationary stochastic process .
we propose a two   layer stochastic process model inspired from @xcite .
we build a new poisson hidden markov model ( p   hmm ) @xcite , in which the first ( hidden ) layer is a discrete time markov chain whose states represent different video activity levels ; the second layer represents the frame size sequence corresponding to a given activity level .
we make the following assumptions about the non   stationarity of the sources :    1 .
the activity level of the video content varies in time according to a poisson distribution ; 2 .
the hidden layer state transitions , ( _ i.e._,the change of the activity level ) occur at the beginning of a gop ; 3 .
the activity level is the same in all views since views are correlated .    with these simplifying assumptions ,
we approximate the duration of scenes with a given activity level , by a simple one parameter distribution .
we discard the possible changes in the average frame size due to activity level changes observed in the middle of a gop .
we will show that , in spite of this approximation , the model closely matches the mvc source characteristics .
let us denote the number of states ( _ i.e._,different video activity levels ) in our model as @xmath6 .
the state duration obeys a poisson distribution denoted by @xmath7 } = \frac{e^{ {\lambda}_i}{\lambda}_i^k}{k!}.\ ] ] when a state transition occurs , the model is described by a state transition matrix @xmath8 , whose element @xmath9 denotes the probability of transition from state @xmath10 to state @xmath11 .
because of the explicit modeling of the state duration time distribution , @xmath12 for all @xmath10
. finally , @xmath13 denotes the initial probability of the model being in state @xmath10 .
the second layer in our model describes the frame sizes in an entire gop .
formally , let us consider the random vector @xmath14 } = [ { { { x}}_{0}[n ] } , \dots , { { { x}}_{{n_{f}} 1}[n]}]\ ] ] representing the set of frames sizes in the @xmath15 th gop of the compressed multiview content . the vector @xmath16}$ ] is emitted in accordance to a multivariate probability mass function ( _ pmf _ ) depending on the actual hidden layer state .
given the current state in the first layer of the model , say @xmath10 , a random vector @xmath16}$ ] is generated according to the _ pmf _
@xmath17}]$ ] . for the sake of compactness ,
each _ pmf _  @xmath18 $ ] , @xmath19 , has a different number of bins depending on the coding mode ( namely i , p , or b   frames ) of the compressed picture to be generated .
this choice is motivated by not imposing that the frame size _ pmf
_   follows a fixed probability distribution ( _ e.g._,gaussian , gamma ,  ) , but instead by adapting the distribution shape to the actual mvc sequences .
moreover , by allowing a different number of bins for different frame types , we can adaptively control the model s complexity ( _ i.e._,the parameter set ) according to the desired accuracy performance .
the estimation of the model parameters is a crucial step in traffic characterization .
since the model belongs to the wide hmm family @xcite , we can resort to one of the estimation algorithms employed for such models . in particular ,
an estimation procedure called expectation   maximization ( em ) algorithm @xcite is widely used for hmms .
a version of the em algorithm has been proposed for p   hmms in @xcite .
however , it exhibits numerical instability when used for long data sequences @xcite . we derive here a new em algorithm for stable parameter estimation in long sequences .
our algorithm extends the method of @xcite to the case of non   stationary hidden state durations .
we present the parameter estimation in detail below .
suppose that we observe a video sequence composed of @xmath20 gops .
let @xmath21 } \}_{n=0}^{n 1 } $ ] denote the observed video traffic and @xmath22 the parameter set of our model , where @xmath23 is the parameter space and @xmath24},{\pi_{1 } } , \dots , { \lambda}_{{n_{s } } } , { b_{{{n_{s}}}}[\cdot]},{\pi_{{{n_{s } } } } } \}$ ] .
the em algorithm comprises two iterative computational steps .
the first one is an expectation step that computes the auxiliary likelihood function @xmath25 , in which @xmath26 represents a plausible state sequence and @xmath27 is the @xmath28 th estimate of the parameter set .
then , a maximization step maximizes the likelihood function , _
i.e._,@xmath29 the algorithm iterates between the two steps until convergence of the parameter set .    before getting into more details ,
let us define a function @xmath30}$ ] representing the state duration distribution and taking into account the finite length of the observed sequence , as @xmath31 } = \begin{cases } 1 {d_{i}[k 1 ] } & \text{if } \;\;k = { n}  n   1\\[10pt ] { d_{i}[k ] } & \text{otherwise } \end{cases}.\ ] ] the parameter @xmath32}$ ] is the cumulative distribution of the state duration times .
then , the computations in our em algorithm , as applied to p   hmms , comprise i ) the computation of forward probabilities , ii ) the computation of backward probabilities , iii ) the estimation of the parameter set .
the first two steps calculate three auxiliary variables , namely the conditioned probabilities of the state sequence to the observed sequence , representing the expectation steps of our em algorithm ( see @xcite for further details ) .
then , the parameter set is expressed as function of these auxilary variables .
we first define the following forward probabilities for @xmath33 @xmath34 & { \alpha_{n}(i ) } { \mathop { = } \limits^{\text{def}}}p(s_n = i| { { y}}_0^n,{\theta}^{(m)})\label{eq : alfa}. \ ] ] for @xmath35 the definitions above are slightly different in order to take into account the finite length of the actual sequence @xmath36 those quantities are calculated by the recursive algorithm illustrated in algorithm [ tab : alfa ] is calculated by summation over @xmath10 and @xmath37 . ] .
they represent the probability for the system to be in state @xmath10 at time @xmath15 and to stay in the same state for the next @xmath37 instants , given the sequence observed till time @xmath15 .
1.5    @xmath38}{b_{i}[{{{y}}[0 ] } ] } $ ] @xmath39}]}(\sum_{\substack{j = 1\\j \ne i}}^{{n_{s}}}{\alpha_{n 1}(j,0)}{\pi_{ji}}{\dot{d}_{i}[k ] } + { \alpha_{n 1}(i , k+1 ) } ) $ ] @xmath40    then , the following backward probabilities are defined in a similar way    @xmath41 & \begin{aligned } { \xi_{n}(i , j , k ) } & { \mathop { = } \limits^{\text{def}}}p(s_{n 1 } = i,\ s_{n } = j,\\ & \dots , s_{n+k } = j , s_{n+k+1 } \ne j   | { { { y}}_0^{n 1}},{\theta}^{(m)}),\\ & n = 1 , \dots , { n}  1;\ k < { n}  n   1.\label{eq : xid } \end{aligned}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    note that we resort to a different definition for the backward probabilities with respect to the usual @xmath42  notation @xcite . in @xcite ,
a @xmath42  backward probability is defined representing the likelihood of the observed sequence , and @xmath43  and @xmath44  are calculated by means of @xmath45  and @xmath42 . here ,
we calculate directly @xmath43  and @xmath44   in a backward iteration in order to avoid numerical issues arising from the sequence length .
the algorithm [ tab : xi ] illustrates the backward probabilities computation , where @xmath46 denotes the kronecker function .
1.5    @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50}+ { \delta_{i}^{j}}{\alpha_{n 1}(i , k+1)}}{\sum_{l = 1}^{{{n_{s } } } } { \alpha_{n 1}(l,0)}{\pi_{lj}}{\dot{d}_{j}[k]}+ { \delta_{l}^{j}}{\alpha_{n 1}(l , k+1)}}\cdot{\gamma_{n}(j , k)}$ ]    finally , the parameter set @xmath51 in the maximization step can be calculated with the help of the forward and the backward probabilities above .
we can write the initial probability of being in state @xmath10 as : @xmath52 then we can express the transition probabilities as : @xmath53 the frame size distribution in each state is given by : @xmath54 } = \frac{\sum_{n=0}^{{n} 1}\sum_{k=0}^{{n} n 1}{\gamma_{n}(i , k)}{\delta_{{{x}}}^{{{{y}}[n]}}}}{\sum_{n=0}^{{n} 1}\sum_{k=0}^{{n} n 1}{\gamma_{n}(i , k)}}.\ ] ] finally , the state duration is expressed as : @xmath55 note that a single iteration of the estimation algorithm consists of calculating first the state sequence probabilities   , which is the expectation step .
subsequently , we compute the new parameter estimates by averaging the observations weighted with the state probabilities   , which corresponds to the maximization step of an iteration of the algorithm . convergence is assured by jensen s inequality @xcite .
in this section , we assess our model by comparing statistics evaluated on a pseudo   random synthetic traffic generated according to our p   hmm , with the statistics evaluated on a composite mvc test sequence .
the p   hmm parameters are estimated by applying the em algorithm of section [ sec : em ] on the observed composite sequence .
we also test the case in which the test sequence is different from the sequence used to train the model , in order to show the model ability to represent not only the training sequence , but also other sequences with similar content .
a comparison with a well   known single view vbr model is also carried out .
the composite mvc sequences considered in the model assessment are generated by concatenating several tests sequences with very different activity levels , as reported in table [ tab : seq ] .
all the sequences are in cif format , with a frame rate of 25 fps , and @xmath56 views .
the resulting mvc composite sequence is approximately 6 minutes long .
we encode the sequence using the two different gop structures reported in figures [ fig : gop8 ] and [ fig : gop4 ] . both structures exhibit motion compensation dependencies among the views for anchor and non   anchor frames @xcite .
the large number of dependencies accentuates the difference between mvc traffic and simple aggregations of single view traffic .
the two gop structures differ in the number of i and p frames .
the bit   rate variability of sequences encoded using the gop in figure [ fig : gop8 ] is mainly due to the residuals of the motion compensation whereas for sequences encoded using the gop in figure [ fig : gop4 ] ; the bit   rate variability depends on the large number of intra or p frames . for each gop structure ,
different mvc bitstreams have been generated by setting the quantization parameter of the reference view to 10 ( high quality ) , 20 ( medium quality ) , or 40 ( low quality ) , and by adjusting the temporal layers quantization parameter accordingly .
we use jmvc v7.0 to encode the sequences @xcite , then we use the different mvc bitstreams to build traffic models .    . [
tab : seq]test sequences used to generate the compound sequence . [ cols="^,^",options="header " , ]     as we discussed in the previous section , the number of bins in the _ pmf_s of the model may be different for different frame types in order to have a trade   off between performance and model complexity . in our tests
we use the number of bins shown in table [ tab : binsss ] and for the gop structures in figures [ fig : gop8 ] and [ fig : gop4 ] , respectively .
the bins are placed in the interval between the minimum and the maximum observed frame size for each frame type .    in the simulations ,
we employ a 3 state model in order to represent low , medium and high level activity .
a first coarse estimation of the model parameter is performed by labeling each gop of the actual sequence as low , medium or high according to its average frame size .
the thresholds are set in order to have the same number of gops in the three states .
then , a coarse estimation is obtained by evaluating frame size histograms related to each state .
zero   valued bins are set to a low fixed value and the histograms are normalized accordingly .
the transition probability matrix is initializated with positive random values , and the poisson mean values are set to 1 for each state .
after that , the em algorithm is performed as described in section [ sec : em ] using the coarse estimation as starting point .
estimation ends when the difference between the log likelihood of the two most recent iterates is smaller than 0.01 .
finally , synthetic traffic is produced by first generating a state sequence according to the model and then producing synthetic traffic for a gop for each state of the sequence by means of the frame size _ pmf_s .
the bins are converted to the mean frame size of the interval they represent .
the synthetic traffic generation is described in algorithm  [ alg : syn ] .
1.5    initial state @xmath10 extracted according to the distribution @xmath57
@xmath58 @xmath37 extracted from the poisson distribution belonging to the current state , i.e. , @xmath59}$ ] @xmath60 generate a synthetic gop @xmath61}$ ] according to @xmath18 $ ] ; perform state transition according to transition matrix @xmath8 .
we now assess the model s accuracy by first comparing the autocorrelation function ( acf ) and the q   q plot computed on a sequence of frame sizes of the actual mvc encoded sequence ( comprising all the views ) with the respective statistics evaluated on a pseudo   random traffic sequence generated by the p   hmm with parameters estimated from the corresponding composite sequence .
figures [ fig : sta4   10 ] , [ fig : sta4   20 ] and [ fig : sta8   20 ] show the acf and the q   q plot for different compressed mvc sequences .
q   q plot measures how two distributions are similar by comparing their quantiles .
the closer the q   q plot to the bisector of the first and third quadrant , the more similar the two distributions are.it is clear that the statistics evaluated on the synthetic traffic ( p   hmm   a ) closely follow the statistics of the actual mvc sequences , for every gop structure and quantization parameter .
the close match with the actual data is due to the fact that we do not constrain the frame size _
pmf_s to have an explicit probability distribution and that we employ the poisson distribution for the state durations , thus forcing a non   stationary recurrence of the activity levels . in order to validate these conclusions ,
we compare our model to the well   known single view vbr model described in @xcite .
specifically , we focus on the `` model a '' in @xcite , whose main differences with our p   hmm model relate to the frame size distribution and the hidden chain describing the activity level .
the model a employs three shifted gamma distributions for the sizes of frames ( i , p , b ) and a stationary 7 state markov chain for the activity level .
moreover , an ad   hoc parameter estimation procedure is used in @xcite .
we see in the figures [ fig : sta4   10 ] , [ fig : sta4   20 ] and [ fig : sta8   20 ] that model a is not able to describe it correctly .
in particular , we can see that model a does not depict accurately the shape of the actual sequence , both for the q   q plots and the autocorrelation function .
we finally consider the case in which our model is trained with a different sequence with respect to the test sequence , we denote the synthetic traffic generated by this model as p   hmm   b .
p   hmm   a outperforms the other models in mimicking the overall frame size distribution while p   hmm   b also achieves good adherence performance .    the same statistics have been calculated separately on the traffic related to each view in mvc streams .
figures [ fig : sta8   20   1 ] and [ fig : sta8   20   3 ] show these statistics for the view # 1 and view # 3 , respectively .
similar results have been obtained for different encoder settings .
again , it is clear that model a @xcite is not able to capture the statistics for each single view .
conversely , our models can characterize efficiently the traffic for each view .
the characterization of the first and second order statistics for every view makes the model attractive to describe real mvc traffic in network applications , where a subset of the views are transmitted to the receivers .
the good results obtained with phmm   b show that the model is able to capture features that are not only related to a single mvc stream , but also to a class of sequences sharing similar content characteristics .
finally , we remark that the slight divergence in terms of autocorrelation function is caused by neglecting the intra   gop correlation in the model design .
we examine the accuracy of our model in the context of multiview services . we consider two case studies illustrated in figure [ fig : sys ] . in the first one , called `` multiview tv ''
, the server sends all the mvc content to the user . in the second one ,
denoted as `` interactive tv '' , the user requests one view at the time and can switch dynamically among the available views during the playout , exploiting an out   of   band feedback control channel .
due to the coding dependencies , the reference views still have to be transmitted along with the target view in the interactive tv service .        from the point of view of the mvc source model ,
the above services differ in that the traffic generated during the multiview tv session depends only on the encoded video , whereas the traffic generated during the interactive tv session depends also on the view selection process .
thereby , in order to fully characterize the latter scenario , we develop a new model of the view switching sequence , inspired by related models in the context of channel switching in iptv systems @xcite @xcite . in the design of our view switching model ,
we employ the following assumptions :    1 .
a user watches the reference view most of the time ; 2 .
other views are occasionally selected by the user because they represent added content with respect to the main view ( _ e.g._,in a football game , these views may describe the foreground of the players ) ; 3 .
a user selects views with preferences that depend on the present view the user is currently watching ( first order dependency ) .
we model the view switching sequence as a chain in which the states represent different views .
the duration of stay in each view is explicitly modeled with a probability distribution . according to the above assumptions , we select sample values for the view transition probabilities , which are reported in table [ tab : swmat ] .
the average and standard deviation of state durations are also set to sample values corresponding to the above assumptions ( see table [ tab : swmat ] ) .
we have found that the gamma distribution is suitable and flexible for modeling the duration time , since it takes only non   negative values with mean and standard deviation that are features independent .
formally , let @xmath62}$ ] be the density function for the duration time in state @xmath10 : @xmath63 } { \mathop { = } \limits^{\text{def}}}\frac{\beta_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}}{\gamma(\alpha_{i } ) } k^{\alpha_{i} 1 } e^{ \beta_{i } { k } } \text { for } k \geq 0\ ] ] the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 are derived from the mean and the standard deviation of duration time for the corresponding state , respectively @xmath66 and @xmath67 , according to the following expressions : @xmath68 & \beta_{i } = \frac{{\mu_{i}}}{{\sigma_{i}}^2 } \end{cases}\ ] ] note that the specific model of user behavior employed in the performance analysis is however not critical , and a similar study could be conducted with other behavior models .
we compare the traffic load due to the h.264 mvc source and the synthetic video traffic trace generated by our p   hmm model in both network scenarios defined above .
we consider that the mvc traffic is fed into the transmission buffer @xmath69that is characterized by a buffer size @xmath70and an output rate _
( see figure [ fig : sys ] ) .
the transmission buffer adopts a first in first out ( fifo ) scheduling policy .
the buffer output is encapsulated into networks packets in accordance with network packetization rules and transmitted to the destination through the channel
. each packet might be affected by a different ( random ) delay during transmission .
the delay @xmath71}$ ] is the sum of the channel delay @xmath72}$ ] and the transmission buffer delay @xmath73}$ ] . for modeling the channel delay @xmath72}$ ] , we resort to the quite general and complete channel model introduced by miao and chou . ]
after an initial prefetch delay _
( namely _ d_= 2 sec . in our study ) from the arrival time of the first frame , the playout buffer is drained at a rate given by the mvc compressed stream .
if frames are not available in the playout buffer at their decoding deadline , they are considered as lost .
we consider three different values for the channel rate , namely 1 , 1.5 , or 2 times the average bitrate of the mvc source rate .
we denote the ratio between the channel rate and then average source rate by the factor @xmath74 .
we have generated a 25 minute long multiview test sequence , by concatenating the streams described in table [ tab : seq ] , similarly to the sequences used in section [ sec : simset ] .
a 3 state model is built by running the em algorithm on the actual sequence using the same procedure as section [ sec : simset ] .
for each sequence , we generated two streams with high ( q=10 ) and low ( q=40 ) quality , respectively .
we then study the accuracy of our model by comparing the traffic and more particularly the loss rate due to late packets , for both the synthetic traffic and the actual mvc sequence .
the loss rate is defined as the ratio between the number of lost frames and the number of transmitted frames at both the sender and receiver buffers .
the frame loss rate is averaged over 10 monte carlo simulations .
first , we compare the sender buffer frame loss rate for different values of the buffer size .
figures [ fig:3dtvq40tx ] , [ fig:3dtvq10tx ] and figures [ fig : inttvq40tx ] , [ fig : inttvq10tx ] show respectively these results for the multiview tv and the interactive tv cases , at different channel rates and stream quality values .
it can be seen that the actual mvc sequence and the synthetic sequence share a similar frame loss rate for different channel rates and transmission buffer sizes .
note that the close similarity is due to the model s capability to describe higher order statistics by means of the non   stationary activity level chain .
finally , we compare the overall frame loss rate , i.e. , the sum of lost frames at both the sender and receiver buffers , divided by the total number of frames , as a function of the receiver buffer size . figures [ fig:3dtvq40rx ] , [ fig:3dtvq10rx ] and figures [ fig : inttvq40rx ] , [ fig : inttvq10rx ] show these results for the multiview tv and interactive tv cases , respectively . table [ tab : flr ] summarizes these results for other test settings , quantifying the model s accuracy as the average absolute difference @xmath75 of the frame loss rate , between the real sequence and the synthetic sequence .
the average is taken over the different buffer sizes under consideration and the frame loss rate is expressed in percent .
it can be seen that the synthetic sequence closely follows the behavior of the actual mvc source ; specifically , the difference between the frame loss rate of the model and the one of the actual sequence is smaller than 0.03 for most of the playout buffer sizes under examination .
since the frame arrival time at the play   out buffer depends on the size of the previous frames that are transmitted , the close similarity between the synthetic and the actual traffic demonstrates the accuracy of the model in characterizing mvc traffic statistics . in addition , even the p   hmm   b model , which is trained on different sequences than the test sequences , is able to capture relevant traffic features of actual data thus providing a good frame loss rate estimation for both transmission and play   out buffer , as seen from table [ tab : flr ] .
therefore , the p   hmm can replace real mvc sequences in the dimensioning of transmit and receive buffers .
it can be employed both for synthetic trace generation as well as for theoretical network performance analysis .
in this paper , we have presented a new stochastic model characterizing the frame size sequence for mvc variable bit rate ( vbr ) sources .
the model exploits a poisson hidden markov model representing the random frame sizes of the different mvc encoded views as a function of the random real video scene activity variations .
we have also derived a stable em algorithm that is applicable to long data sequences for the p   hmm parameter estimation .
we have shown through extensive simulations that our model accurately predicts the sequence of frame sizes in an mvc stream .
we have also applied our model to traffic load prediction in two different network scenarios , namely a multiview tv service and an interactive tv service .
simulation results show that the synthetic traffic generated by the proposed model strongly resembles the traffic due to real mvc video traces .
the model is able to accurately characterize a class of mvc streams sharing similar content characteristics with the training data .
the model is therefore an appropriate tool for different networking problems , such as network dimensioning , resource allocation , and call admission control .

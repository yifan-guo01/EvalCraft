numerical modeling of dynamic spacetimes containing black holes ( bhs ) in the framework of einstein s theory has been motivated for a large part of its nearly 50 year long history by the calculation of the gravitational wave ( gw ) signals generated by bh binary systems .
these efforts culminated in 2005 in the first evolutions of bh binaries through inspiral , merger and ringdown@xcite . over the following years
, numerical relativity ( nr ) simulations have been used in the construction of gw template banks @xcite fundamental for signal searches in gw detectors such as ligo , virgo and geo600 @xcite and have also been studied in the context of gw data analysis @xcite .
ninja_@xcite and _ nrar_@xcite collaborations in particular combine the resources of various nr groups with the analytic relativity and gravitational   wave data analysis community .
nr studies have furthermore provided valuable insight into a variety of astrophysical scenarios involving bhs as for example the study of gravitational recoil @xcite , jet phenomena @xcite and electromagnetic counterparts for multi   messenger astrophysics @xcite . for reviews of these subjects
we refer to refs .  .
in recent years , however , nr has also emerged as a valuable tool to explore high   energy physics scenarios @xcite .
the purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the most recent developments in these areas which , for reasons of clarity , we divide into three categories : ( i ) numerical studies of fundamental properties of bh spacetimes , ( ii ) applications to the modeling of trans   planckian scattering and ( iii ) the gauge gravity duality .
this division is not entirely rigorous and we will encounter scenarios of relevance for more than one of these major topics . for example the stability of rotating bhs in higher dimensions is discussed in sec .
[ sec : fundamental ] on fundamental properties of bhs but likely also affects the signature in the conjectured formation of mini bhs in trans   planckian scattering events .
wherever present , we will emphasize such significance across our somewhat arbitrarily chosen distinction .
nr studies in the context of high   energy physics and fundamental properties of classical general relativity frequently involve bhs in higher dimensional spacetimes .
in some cases , however , valuable insight can be inferred as well from the more traditional case of spacetimes with `` 3 + 1 '' dimensions ( three spatial and one time   like ) .
somewhat in breach of its title , this work is therefore not entirely limited to the numerical investigation of higher   dimensional bhs . as complementary reading to this article ,
we note review articles including nr applications in high   energy physics by pretorius@xcite , cardoso _
et al._@xcite and yoshino & shibata@xcite . an extended discussion of bhs in higher dimensions is given in .
the remainder of this article is organized as follows .
we begin with a brief summary of the nr techniques in sec .
[ sec : nr ] .
the above mentioned main applications of nr to higher   dimensional bhs will be reviewed in secs .
[ sec : fundamental ] , [ sec : transplanckian ] and [ sec : adscft ] . in each of these
we will provide a brief motivation of the corresponding studies and list more specialized review articles for further reading .
we will conclude in sec .
[ sec : conclusions ] . unless noted otherwise , we use units such that the speed of light @xmath0 .
formulations of the einstein equations suitable for nr can be classified into two main groups .
the characteristic bondi   sachs@xcite formalism is based on the characteristic surfaces of the vacuum einstein equations .
this formalism leads to a natural hierarchy of the equations which reflects the isolation of the gravitational degrees of freedom ; in the four   dimensional case , for example , one obtains one trivial equation , three complementary equations , four hypersurface equations and two evolution equations for the degrees of freedom .
a difficulty arising in the characteristic approach is the potential formation of caustics and the ensuing breakdown of the coordinate system . for the classical general   relativistic two   body problem , the inspiral and merger of two bhs ,
a robust solution for this problem has not yet been found .
nevertheless , characteristic methods have been employed with great success in various codes studying configurations with additional symmetries , most notably in the series of studies by chesler & yaffe@xcite on thermalization of quark   gluon plasmas through the anti   de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence .
characteristic evolutions are reviewed in detail by winicour@xcite .
the majority of work on the inspiral and coalescence of compact binaries , including the 2005 breakthroughs , however , has been performed in 3 + 1 approaches . here
spacetime is decomposed into a one   parameter family of three or , more generally , @xmath1 dimensional , spatial hypersurfaces . the canonical 3 + 1 split has been developed by arnowitt , deser and misner@xcite ( adm ) , reformulated by york@xcite and leads to a system of six second   order evolution equations for the induced spatial metric and four constraint equations , the hamiltonian and momentum constraints .
introduction of the extrinsic curvature as an evolution variable converts the evolution equations into a first   order   in   time system . by performing a conformal rescaling of the spatial metric , a decomposition of the extrinsic curvature into trace and a trace   free part and evolving the contracted christoffel symbol as separate fields , baumgarte , shapiro , shibata and
nakamura@xcite have developed a strongly hyperbolic formulation@xcite commonly referred to as `` bssn '' which has been used with great success by many numerical groups .
the adm / bssn approach to numerical relativity is discussed in great detail in .
an alternative cauchy   type formulation has been derived from the einstein equations in harmonic gauge where they take on a manifestly hyperbolic form .
the harmonic gauge can be generalized to arbitrary gauge choices by introducing source functions for the coordinate conditions @xcite .
more details of this _ generalized harmonic gauge _ ( ghg ) formulation can be found in .
the ghg and bssn methods have been the foundation of the numerical relativity breakthroughs of 2005 by pretorius@xcite and the brownsville and goddard groups@xcite .
nr applications in higher   dimensional spacetimes have so far been restricted to configurations with symmetry assumptions .
this is largely a consequence of the vast increase in computational resources required by each additional dimension .
a reduction of higher   dimensional general relativity to an effective 3 + 1 or lower   dimensional computational domain has been achieved in various ways .
the most evident approach is to directly impose the symmetry together with the coordinate conditions on the line element .
for example , sorkin & oren@xcite describe the @xmath2 dimensional , spherically symmetric spacetime in double   null coordinates @xmath3 by the line element @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the metric on a @xmath6 dimensional unit hyper sphere and @xmath7 is the areal radius . the time evolution is then determined by the einstein equations derived from this metric ; see their eqs .
( 3) (6 ) .
alternatively , a general procedure for a dimensional reduction under the assumption of one or more killing vectors is given by geroch@xcite . by using this procedure
, the @xmath2 dimensional einstein equations with @xmath8 symmetries can be converted to an effective 3 + 1 scheme coupled to scalar or vector fields which represent the curvature of the extra   dimensions@xcite .
such a dimensional reduction is particularly attractive because it provides a straightforward way to apply the successful numerical techniques developed in 3 + 1 with relatively minor modifications to the study of higher dimensional spacetimes .
a different way to achieve the same goal is based on the _ cartoon method_@xcite which employs interpolation of grid functions and/or trading of spatial derivatives to evolve symmetric spacetimes on a reduced cartesian grid .
this approach has been modified and extended to higher   dimensional applications by pretorius@xcite and yoshino & shibata@xcite and has proven a rather robust tool to study bh collisions and instabilities .
the generation of initial data in higher   dimensional spacetimes relies to a significant extent on similar techniques developed for the 3 + 1 case ; see cooks@xcite review .
in particular , it has been shown by yoshino _
et al._@xcite that the existence of analytic solutions of bowen   york@xcite type for the momentum constraints carries over to general relativity in @xmath2 dimensions . solving the hamiltonian constraint for the conformal factor
can then be achieved by numerical methods similar to those developed for 3 + 1 dimensions . by using this procedure , initial data for bh binaries with boost
have been obtained in refs .  .
for specific numerical studies , analytic initial data is available in closed form , as for example the @xmath2 dimensional generalization of brill   lindquist@xcite data describing a bh binary at the moment of time symmetry .
analytic bh solutions can also be employed to construct approximate solutions to the einstein constraints by superposition of either the solutions themselves or boosted variants thereof .    for more details on the numerical methods , the construction of initial data and gauge choices , we refer the reader to the publications reviewed in the following sections .
bhs play a central role in the applications of nr to higher   dimensional spacetimes discussed in secs .
[ sec : transplanckian ] and [ sec : adscft ] . quite aside from these applications , bhs provide a unique probe for deepening our insight into the gravitational theory and understanding in which regards 3 + 1 dimensions represent a special case .
bhs in higher dimensions indeed reveal a much richer phenomenology than their four   dimensional cousins ; cf .
emparan & reall@xcite .
asymptotically flat , stationary solutions of the einstein equations in vacuum in 3 + 1 dimensions belong to the kerr family and describe single bhs of spherical topology characterized by two parameters , the mass @xmath9 and angular momentum parameter @xmath10 @xcite .
the stability of these solutions has been studied extensively ; see for example refs .   and dafermos@xcite review .
such classical bh solutions are expected to be stable in the region outside the horizon , but admit instabilities in the interior@xcite .
penrose s _ cosmic censorship_@xcite furthermore conjectures that collapse of ordinary matter does not lead to the formation of naked singularities ; instead such singularities are hidden from outside view through an event horizon .
bhs in higher dimensions are solutions to the @xmath2 dimensional einstein equations ] @xmath11 for the vacuum case @xmath12 .
solutions to these equations can be generated straightforwardly from extending the four   dimensional schwarzschild metric with one or more flat dimensions .
these _ black strings _ or _
black branes _ are susceptible to the gregory   laflamme@xcite ( gl ) instability related to the vastly different length scales in the horizon geometry .
these solutions furthermore suggest a modification of thornes@xcite hoop conjecture ; if an amount @xmath9 of mass   energy is compressed into a volume such that its circumference is below its schwarzschild radius in every direction , a bh forms .
the existence of black branes indicates that such a concentration of energy is sufficient in a subset of the spatial directions .
the @xmath2 dimensional generalization of the spherically symmetric schwarzschild solution is given by the tangherlini@xcite metric @xmath13 where the constant @xmath14 determines the bh mass @xmath15 .
here , @xmath16 denotes the surface area of the @xmath6 dimensional unit hypersphere .
note that mass is now of dimension @xmath17 .
schwarzschild solutions in @xmath2 dimensions have been found to be stable against linearized gravitational perturbations@xcite .
in contrast to their spherically symmetric counterparts , the class of rotating bh solutions exhibits a vastly richer structure in higher dimensions .
first , rotation is now possible in more than one plane , giving rise to more than one rotation parameter .
second , the radial dependence of the newtonian potential is altered to @xmath18 whereas the centrifugal potential maintains its @xmath19 character .
this @xmath2 dependent character of the newtonian potential manifests itself in the absence of stable circular geodesics for @xmath20@xcite .
quite remarkably , myers & perry@xcite found an exact solution describing bhs rotating in all possible planes . in @xmath21 and @xmath22 ,
bhs rotating in one plane with rotation parameter @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively represent naked singularities . in @xmath25 ,
in contrast , there exists a horizon for all values of @xmath10 .
furthermore , in the limit of infinite rotation rate , this horizon becomes increasingly flattened along the rotation plane@xcite and is therefore expected to be gl unstable .
this has been confirmed in linearized studies by dias _
et al._@xcite . in the case of rotations in more than one plane ,
the existence of horizons in ultra   spinning bh spacetimes requires at least two ( one ) spin parameter to vanish for an odd ( even ) number of dimensions @xmath2 .
rotation in higher dimensions also leads to bh solutions of non   spherical topology . _
black rings _ are supported against contraction by the centrifugal potential ; analytic solutions in @xmath22 have been found in thin rings behave locally like boosted black strings@xcite which are gl unstable@xcite while _ fat _ rings are expected to be unstable to variations of their radius@xcite .
solutions for _ black saturns _ have been constructed in and demonstrate the existence of stationary vacuum multiple   bhs in higher dimensions .
the generalization of the ads   schwarzschild solution@xcite is given by @xmath26 in the limit @xmath27 , this solution reduces to the ads spacetime with curvature radius @xmath28 in _ global _ coordinates ; cf .  sec .
[ sec : adscft ] .
its mass relative to the empty ads solution is given by @xcite @xmath29 .
this solution is stable against linearized gravitational perturbations @xcite .
the four   dimensional kerr   ads spacetime ( see e.  g.  eq .
( 2.1 ) in ) has been found by carter@xcite and generalized to higher dimensions in refs .  .
kerr   ads has been found to be unstable against linear perturbations if the bhs are small@xcite .
one of the first and most influential nr results has been obtained in choptuiks@xcite seminal study of the collapse of spherically symmetric massless scalar fields minimally coupled to einstein gravity in four   dimensional , asymptotically flat spacetimes . by evolving various one   parameter families of scalar pulses
, he identified critical behaviour as the parameter @xmath30 which characterizes the gravitational interaction strength of the field approaches a critical value @xmath31 . for @xmath32 ,
the field collapses to a bh and for @xmath33 it disperses to infinity .
furthermore , near   critical field configurations exhibit _ universal _ behaviour in the strong field limit : ( i ) bhs which form have a mass @xmath34 with a universal constant @xmath35 .
( ii ) advancing the evolution from a time @xmath36 to @xmath37 , the field profile is recovered up to a `` zoom   in '' by a factor @xmath38 .
the numerical study reveals @xmath39 to be a universal constant of about @xmath40 . for subcritical configurations ,
garfinkle & comer duncan @xcite found a similar scaling of the maximal scalar curvature in the spacetime @xmath41 .
continuously self   similar solutions were found by pretorius & choptuik@xcite for scalar fields in 2 + 1 dimensional asymptotically ads spacetimes with a mass scaling characterized by @xmath42 .
sorkin & oren@xcite generalized choptuik s result to higher dimensions by evolving scalar fields up to @xmath43 dimensions .
their results indicate that @xmath44 reaches a maximum and @xmath39 a minimum around @xmath45 .
an extended review of critical collapse phenomena is given by gundlach & martn   garca@xcite .
more recently , critical   collapse studies have been extended to asymptotically ads spacetimes in 3 + 1 and higher dimensions . in a remarkable study , bizo &
rostworowski found evidence suggesting that the 3 + 1 ads is unstable to bh formation under arbitrarily small perturbations . by evolving spherically symmetric scalar fields they recover choptuik s results for large initial field amplitudes . for configurations below this critical value
, however , the ads boundary substantially modifies the outcome .
in contrast to asymptotically flat spacetimes , spatial infinity in ads is reached in finite time by massless fields and reflected back onto the origin . as the initial amplitude is reduced below a critical value @xmath46 , the scalar pulse forms a bh upon its second implosion on the origin
. further reduction of the amplitude leads to a second critical amplitude @xmath47 and this pattern repeats itself with no indication of a threshold amplitude for bh formation ; cf .
their fig .  1 .
for each critical amplitude , they furthermore recover choptuik s scaling law with @xmath48 .
they interpret this behaviour as a resonant mixing of modes which transfers energy from low to high frequencies .
this study has been generalized to higher   dimensional ads spacetimes by jamuna _
et al._@xcite suggesting that ads is unstable to bh formation for generic spacetime dimensions .
presumably , this result has eluded a similar study by garfinkle & pando zayas@xcite , because of insufficient length of their numerical simulations for smaller field amplitudes . in a similar investigation using complex scalar fields ,
et al._@xcite reproduce the instability of ads and the transfer of energy from low to high frequencies .
in consequence , the width of initially weak pulses narrows in each reflection cycle and eventually collapses to a bh ; cf .
their fig .
@xcite have monitored the time of bh formation and the horizon radius and find the amplitude of the scalar field to have a stronger influence on the outcome compared with the width of the pulse .
the same type of instability to bh formation has been found by maliborski @xcite for a minkowski spacetime enclosed inside a reflecting wall , indicating that the global structure plays a major role for the effect .
perturbative studies support the numerically observed instability of ads @xcite , but the question of the generic stability properties of _ asymptotically _ ads spacetimes , as for example those containing bhs or boson stars , remains under study @xcite .
the instability of black strings has been studied numerically in a sequence of papers by lehner & pretorius and collaborators@xcite , see also .
it had been known since the 1990s that black strings are subject to the gl instability , but the eventual fate of the string remained unclear . in ref .  , lehner & pretorius found evidence supporting indications by earlier work that the string evolves to a sequence of spherical bhs connected by thin string segments which themselves are subject to the gl instability , resulting in a self   similar cascade reaching zero string width in finite asymptotic time .
this behaviour shows striking similarity with satellite formation in the flow of low   viscosity fluids .
the eventual bifurcation of the horizon resulting from the cascade implies formation of a naked singularity@xcite .
because no finetuning is required to trigger the instability , the result constitutes a violation of the cosmic censorship conjecture without `` unnatural '' assumptions about the initial data .
in contrast to the higher   dimensional case , nr has as yet not observed any such violation of cosmic censorship in 3 + 1 dimensions . in a recent study@xcite bh collisions in
asymptotically de sitter spacetimes have been found to comply with censorship ; bh binaries with a combined mass exceeding the inverse of the hubble constant do not merge for any initial separation provided the initial data do not contain a naked singularity .
we have already mentioned the linear instability of rapidly rotating myers   perry bhs .
the stability of rotating bhs has been studied numerically by yoshino & shibata@xcite who evolve single holes with a bar   shaped perturbation imposed on the conformal factor in @xmath49 dimensions . in all cases ,
they observe bhs spinning above a threshold dimensionless spin   parameter @xmath50 to spontaneously emit gravitational waves and settle down into a subcritical configuration . expressed in terms of the ratio of polar to equatorial circumference @xmath51 of the apparent horizon
, the onset of instability occurs for nearly identical values for @xmath25 , namely @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , for @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .
in contrast , they obtain a significantly stronger distortion threshold @xmath58 in @xmath22 indicating a somewhat special status of @xmath22 ; we recall in this context the absence of an upper limit on the spin in @xmath25 .
bhs spinning below the critical rate , on the other hand , show no signs of instability in any of their simulations . the effect of this instability on the evaporation of bhs conjectured to be produced in trans   planckian scattering ( cf .
[ sec : transplanckian ] ) depends on the timescale of the instability and , hence , on the spin parameter of the formed bh ; for details see the discussion in sec .
vi d in ref .  .    even though this review is primarily concerned with time evolutions
, we note that numerical techniques are also applied for finding static and stationary solutions to the @xmath2 dimensional einstein equations in vacuum , as for example the construction of four   dimensional rotating bh solutions in a cavity@xcite or asymptotically ads spacetimes in @xmath22 with a conformally schwarzschild boundary @xcite .
this topic is reviewed in detail by wiseman@xcite .
the standard model of particle physics provides an exceptionally successful description of subatomic particles and their interactions via the electromagnetic , weak and strong forces . in spite of its success ,
however , there remain important unanswered questions , as for example the unknown nature of dark matter . in the context of this section ,
the most important open issue is the large discrepancy between the electroweak energy scale @xmath59 and the grand unification scale @xmath60 .
this so   called _ hierarchy problem _ manifests itself in the extraordinary weakness of the gravitational interaction relative to the other fundamental forces ; the weak interaction is about 32 orders of magnitude stronger than the gravitational one . at energies comparable to the grand unification energy , on the other hand
, gravity is expected to become comparable in strength to the other interactions .    a particularly intriguing solution to the hierarchy problem is the _ add _ model @xcite , which proposes large ( relative to the four   dimensional planck scale @xmath61 ) extra dimensions of radius @xmath62 such that the fundamental planck scale @xmath63 may be as low as @xmath64 . consider for illustration the poisson equation in @xmath1 spatial dimensions for a point source @xmath65 , with the @xmath2 dimensional gravitational constant @xmath66 and the source mass @xmath9 . from gauss s law
we obtain in spherical coordinates @xmath67 at large distances @xmath68 , the extra dimensions are not accessible to the gravitational field and merely contribute an overall volume factor such that @xmath69 whereas for @xmath70 , the potential is determined by the @xmath1 dimensional poisson equation . ignoring geometrical factors of order @xmath71 , we thus obtain @xmath72 at large distances we thus recover the usual @xmath73 potential with a four   dimensional coupling constant @xmath74 which implies for the energy scales @xmath75 . for example , a fundamental planck mass @xmath63 of the order of the electroweak scale requires @xmath76 in @xmath22 ( ruled out experimentally ) or @xmath77 for @xmath55 . in a different version of the model proposed by randall & sundrum@xcite , a finite length scale is introduced through a warp factor into otherwise infinite extra dimensions .    an intriguing consequence of an effective planck mass much below its four   dimensional value @xmath60 is the possibility of bh formation in parton   parton collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite ; see also the reviews by cavagli @xcite and kanti @xcite .
once formed , such mini bhs are expected to evaporate in four stages @xcite : ( i ) a balding phase during which the bh sheds all multipoles except for mass , spin and charge , ( ii ) a spin   down and ( iii ) a schwarzschild phase during which the bh looses first its spin and then its mass via semi   classical hawking radiation and ( iv ) the planck regime as the bh mass approaches the planck mass which is described by an as yet unknown theory of quantum gravity .    of particular interest in the context of nr is the fact that the first three of these phases should be well described by classical and semi   classical calculations provided the bh mass exceeds the planck scale by at least a factor of a few @xcite .
if we further assume that most of the energy of the collision process resides in the kinetic energy of the particles , such that their internal structure becomes negligible , the dynamics of the collision should be well modeled by two point particles or bhs in @xmath2 dimensional general relativity @xcite . testing this assumption forms one of the main motivations for nr applications and we shall return to this question shortly .
bh formation is expected to manifest itself in collision experiments by a special signature in its decay products as for example the jet multiplicity or transverse energy @xcite . for the identification of these signatures , theoretical predictions from monte   carlo event generators such as blackmax @xcite and charybdis @xcite
are compared with experimental data .
key input parameters for the event generators are the scattering cross section for bh formation and the initial mass and spin distributions of the formed holes . providing this
information forms a second main challenge for nr to complement estimates obtained from perturbative calculations on superposed aichelburg   sexl shock   wave backgrounds @xcite .
the most recent analysis of data taken from collisions at the lhc with energies up to @xmath78 excludes semi   classical bhs of mass below @xmath79 @xcite and sets exclusion contours in the plane formed by the bh mass and the threshold mass separating the semi   classical from the quantum regime @xcite .
it thus appears unlikely that the most optimistic tev   gravity models with @xmath80 are those realized in nature .    in summary ,
the main questions to be addressed by nr simulations are ( i ) the validity of the hoop conjecture in highly dynamical configurations , ( ii ) the scattering threshold for bh formation , ( iii ) the mass and spin parameters of the formed bhs and ( iv ) the impact of the colliding objects structure on the dynamics .
high   energy collisions in the framework of general relativity are currently best understood in @xmath21 dimensions , largely because the numerical infrastructure for this setting is most advanced and robust .
even though generalization of the results to arbitrary spacetime dimensionality will ultimately be essential , a great deal of insight can be and has already been obtained in the four   dimensional case .
we shall review these results before plunging into the latest developments on collisions for arbitrary @xmath2 .
the expectation of bh formation in high   energy collisions dominated by gravitational interaction is closely tied to thorne s hoop conjecture @xcite . applied to head   on collisions with boost factor @xmath44 , we expect two objects , each of rest mass @xmath81 and size @xmath82 , to form a bh if the schwarzschild radius @xmath83 associated with @xmath9 satisfies @xmath84 , i.  e.  @xmath85 .
choptuik & pretorius @xcite tested this scenario by numerically simulating head   on collisions of boosted boson stars in @xmath21 dimensions .
their initial configurations consist of two boson stars with compactness @xmath86 and the hoop conjecture would imply bh formation for boost factors @xmath87 .
their numerical results demonstrate bh formation for @xmath88 , a factor a few below the hoop conjecture and thus strengthening the expectation that kinetic   energy dominated collisions indeed produce bhs .
this picture has recently been confirmed in head   on collisions of fluid particles in refs .  .
the energy radiated in gravitational waves ( gws ) reported by east & pretorius@xcite is @xmath89 for @xmath90 , in good agreement with ultrarelativistic limits @xmath91 and @xmath92 obtained from perturbative calculations @xcite and numerical simulations of bh head   on collisions @xcite respectively .
these studies strengthen the conjecture that trans   planckian collisions are well described by high   energy collisions of black holes , general relativity s closest analog of point particles .    binary configurations of non   spinning , equal   mass bh binaries are characterized by two parameters , the boost factor @xmath93 and the impact parameter defined as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 , @xmath28 and @xmath96 are the velocity , orbital angular momentum and linear momentum .
the head   on case @xmath97 has been studied by sperhake _
@xcite who evolve a sequence of collisions with @xmath98
. the simulations always result in a merger and extrapolation of the radiated energy to @xmath99 leads to the above mentioned @xmath100 of the center   of   mass ( com ) energy , about a factor 2 below penrose s upper limit @xmath101 quoted in . for grazing collisions ,
the outcome depends on the size of the impact parameter @xmath102 .
et al._@xcite identify three regimes : ( i ) for @xmath103 , the bhs scatter off each other and eventually escape to infinity .
( ii ) in a narrow regime @xmath104 the bhs separate after an initial encounter , but have lost enough energy in gravitational radiation such that they form a bound system and eventually merge . as @xmath102 approaches the _ threshold of immediate merger _
@xmath105 , the binary exhibits the _ zoom   whirl _ behaviour identified by pretorius & khurana@xcite with a number of whirls proportional to the logarithmic distance of @xmath102 from @xmath105 .
( iii ) for sufficiently small @xmath106 , the outcome is a prompt merger . by fitting numerical results obtained for binaries with @xmath107 , shibata _ et al .
_ @xcite have obtained a functional relation for the scattering threshold @xmath108 the numerical studies further demonstrate that grazing collisions with impact parameters near the range @xmath109 generate enormous amounts of gravitational radiation up to at least @xmath110 of the com energy ; for a detailed analysis of the gw emission see berti _
et al._@xcite .
indeed it has been conjectured by pretorius & khurana @xcite that _ all _ kinetic energy may be radiated in the form of gws .
this conjecture has recently been investigated numerically in sperhake _
_ @xcite by monitoring the bh horizon properties in collisions of spinning and non   spinning binaries .
while most of the kinetic energy is indeed radiated for mild boosts @xmath111 , gw absorption by the holes becomes increasingly efficient for larger collision velocities ; cf .
their fig .  1 .
extrapolation of the numerical results to the ultrarelativistic limit predicts that approximately equal fractions of the kinetic energy are absorbed by the bhs as are lost in gravitational radiation , and sets a lower bound on the final bh mass of about half of the com energy .
this study further demonstrates that the impact of the bh spin on the scattering threshold and radiated energy becomes negligible for @xmath112 lending additional support to the modeling of trans   planckian scattering in terms of high   energy collisions of bhs .
the most likely scenarios for bh formation at the lhc are proton   proton collisions
. it will be important , therefore , to investigate the impact of electric charge on the dynamics which has been ignored in the above mentioned studies .
a first exploration of colliding bhs with electric charge has been presented in zilho _
they extract gravitational as well as electromagnetic radiation generated in head   on collisions of bhs with equal mass and charge starting from rest .
as intuitively expected , the electric repulsion slows down the dynamics and leads to a decreasing amount of gw energy @xmath113 as the mass   to   charge ratio @xmath114 increases from @xmath115 towards the extremal case @xmath116 which corresponds to a static , albeit unstable , configuration .
the radiated electromagnetic energy @xmath117 , on the other hand , is maximal near @xmath118 but always remains below the gravitational one with the quotient @xmath119 increasing monotonically as a function of @xmath114 reaching @xmath120 as @xmath121 .
in contrast to the four   dimensional case , bh collisions in @xmath122 spacetime dimensions appear to be more challenging from the view point of numerical stability and have not yet been explored to the same extent .
collisions of two equal   mass , non   spinning bhs starting from rest have been studied by witek _
_ @xcite who use the kodama   ishibashi formalism @xcite for the extraction of gws and find that @xmath123 of the com energy is radiated in gws for @xmath22 , to be compared with @xmath124 in four dimensions @xcite .
these results were generalized to the case of unequal mass ratios @xmath125 in ( cf .
their fig .
3 ) leading to the extreme   mass   ratio limit @xmath126 .
point   particle calculations are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with these nr results@xcite but additionally make very interesting predictions for bh head   on collisions with _ non   zero _ initial velocities @xcite : @xmath127 typically _ decreases _ with @xmath2 to such an extent that for @xmath43 , head   on collisions starting from rest may radiate more gw energy than their ultrarelativistic counterparts ; cf .  fig .  1 in .
this counter   intuitive prediction has yet to be tested with nr methods .
bh collisions in @xmath22 dimensional cylindrical spacetimes have been simulated in .
the cylindrical setup can be viewed in terms of an infinite array of bhs resulting in a breaking effect on the collision dynamics .
the most advanced study of bh scattering in @xmath22 has been performed by okawa _
@xcite who find scattering thresholds @xmath128 decreasing in terms of the schwarzschild radius @xmath129 from @xmath130 at @xmath131 to @xmath132 at @xmath133 . above this
velocity , numerical instabilities prevent a determination of @xmath128 .
in contrast to the four   dimensional case , however , they do not observe any signs of zoom   whirl behaviour , probably due the equal fall   off @xmath134 of the gravitational and centrifugal potential in @xmath22 . by analysing the kretschmann scalar @xmath135
, they further conclude that super   planckian physics may be visible in the scattering of bhs in five spacetime dimensions .
a straightforward calculation shows that for a single bh of mass @xmath9 , the kretschmann scalar on the horizon is given by arising from the different choices of @xmath136 in the einstein equations , our eq .
( [ eq : einstein ] ) and eq .
( 1 ) in . ]
@xmath137 by calculating @xmath138 in the orbital plane , okawa _ et al .
_ observe super   planckian domains where @xmath139 outside the individual holes horizons even for non   merging configurations .
regions with curvature radii below the planck scale may thus form in high   energy particle collisions without being cloaked inside an event horizon .
the gauge   gravity duality conjectures the mathematical equivalence or _ duality _ between field theories involving gravity in @xmath2 dimensions on the one side and field theories without gravity in @xmath1 dimensions on the other .
it is one of the most remarkable results of string theory and , because of maldacena s prototypical example @xcite of the duality between type iib string theory in 5 dimensional ads space times the @xmath140 sphere and the @xmath141 supersymmetric @xmath142 yang   mills ( sym ) cft in 4 dimensions , often referred to as the ads / cft correspondence .
following maldacena s original example , a large number of similar dualities have been conjectured ; see for example chapter 13 in ref .  .
many of these involve type iib string theory or @xmath9 theory compactified on @xmath143 times a sphere or torus .
the best understood example to date , however , is given by maldacena s prototype which is also the version underlying present nr studies and , hence , the one we shall focus on in the remainder of this section .    the ads / cft correspondence , while not rigorously proven , is inspired and supported by a variety of features displayed by the two theories involved :    * holography : black holes can be regarded as thermodynamic systems with entropy @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the horizon area @xcite . in contrast , the entropy of systems described by local field theories grows in proportion to the volume , suggesting a holographic connection to gravity @xcite .
* symmetries : the isometry group of @xmath146 is @xmath147 which also leave @xmath141 sym invariant .
fermionic symmetries agree similarly and lead to a supergroup @xmath148 which is identical to the @xmath141 superconformal symmetry ; cf .  ref .  .
* @xmath149 branes : a stack of @xmath150 @xmath149 branes has an open   string description equivalent to @xmath141 sym @xcite .
the stack also forms a solution of type iib supergravity , i.  e.  the low   energy limit of type iib string theory@xcite which in the near   horizon limit of the extremal solution reduces to the @xmath146 metric .
this equivalence further relates the coupling constant @xmath151 and number of colors @xmath150 of the gauge theory with the string length and coupling @xmath152 , @xmath153 and the spacetime curvature radius @xmath28 on the gravity side .
specifically , @xmath154 * the hawking   bekenstein entropy associated with the @xmath155 bh of the near   extremal @xmath149 brane is equal to the entropy of a non   ideal gas in @xmath141 sym in the strong t hooft coupling limit @xcite @xmath156 ; cf .   and sec .  2.3 in .
* the ratio of shear viscosity @xmath157 to entropy density @xmath158 is conjectured to have a lower bound given by the value @xmath159 which is universal to all theories with a gravity dual @xcite .
this bound appears to be satisfied by all known liquids .
* ads / cft based studies ( cf .  below ) predict rapid thermalization on time scales @xmath160 for quark   gluon plasma produced at brookhaven s relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in agreement with observations @xcite .
one of the most valuable properties of the correspondence arises from eq .
( [ eq : parameters ] ) .
the duality is strongly / weakly coupled and can be applied in both directions : strong coupling of the gauge theory @xmath161 corresponds to @xmath162 , i.  e.  the regime of validity of general relativity , while the gauge theory is rather well understood for small @xmath163 and may provide information about the strongly coupled limit of string   theory . we need to bear in mind , however , that the correspondence applies to cousins of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) instead of qcd itself .
nevertheless , the correspondence provides an unprecedented opportunity to theoretically model physical systems in the strong   coupling regime of field theories and , as demonstrated by the above mentioned studies on shear viscosity and thermalization of quark   gluon plasma , is capable of making qualitatively and even quantitatively accurate predictions for physical systems .
reviews of the ads / cft correspondence with varying levels of detail are given in .
for an overview of potential applications in fluid dynamics , condensed matter physics , super conductors and super fluidity we refer to refs .  .
anti   de sitter space in @xmath2 dimensions @xmath164 is the maximally symmetric solution of the @xmath2 dimensional vacuum einstein equations with cosmological constant @xmath165 @xmath166 it can be represented as the hyperboloid @xmath167 embedded in a @xmath168 dimensional flat spacetime of signature @xmath169 with metric @xmath170 transforming to coordinates @xmath171 with hyperspherical coordinates : @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 . ]
@xmath177 , we obtain @xmath164 in global coordinates with metric @xmath178 where @xmath179 , @xmath180 . by unwrapping the cylindrical direction ,
the range of the time coordinate is often extended to @xmath181 .    alternatively , poincar coordinates @xmath182 defined by @xmath183,~~    x_i = \frac{lx^i}{z},~~{\rm for}~~i=1\ldots d 2 , \nonumber \\    & & x_{d 1 } = \frac{1}{2z } \left[z^2   l^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{d 2}(x^i)^2 = t^2        \right],~~    x_d = \frac{lt}{z},\end{aligned}\ ] ] give the ads metric in the form @xmath184\ , ,    \label{eq : ads_poincare}\ ] ] with @xmath185 , @xmath186 .
poincar coordinates cover only half the hyperboloid ( the other half corresponding to @xmath187 ) and this patch is often referred to as the _ poincar wedge_. for its relation to global ads see for example .    at the ads boundary @xmath188 or @xmath189 , the ads metric becomes singular .
it therefore induces a conformal class of metrics at the boundary , i.  e.  the induced metric is determined up to a conformal rescaling only .
this remaining freedom manifests itself in the boundary topology of the global and poincar metrics . in the limit @xmath188 or @xmath189 , eqs .
( [ eq : ads_globalmetric ] ) and ( [ eq : ads_poincare ] ) become respectively @xmath190 which can be related by a conformal transformation ; cf .
( 8.17 ) in . in consequence , gravity in global or poincar ads is related to field theories on spacetimes of different topology : @xmath191 in the former and @xmath192 in the latter case .
there remains the extraction of physical quantities of the field theory from the gravitational side .
this _ dictionary _ between bulk and boundary physics is established by the equivalence of the gravitational action of the bulk taken in the limit of the boundary and the effective action of the field theory on the boundary @xcite .
this duality involves divergences on both sides , _ infrared _ divergences on the gravity side due to the singular nature of the metric on the boundary and _ ultraviolet _ divergences of the quantum field theory .
these anomalies and their elimination through renormalization have been discussed in .
nr applications have so far focused on the calculation of the vacuum expectation values of the field theory s energy momentum tensor @xmath193 corresponding to the gravitational sector in the bulk and we shall only consider this case here . for a discussion including matter fields see for example sec .  5 in as well as .    through the ads / cft correspondence , the vacuum expectation values @xmath193 of the field theory
are given by the quasi   local brown   york @xcite stress   energy tensor and thus directly related to the bulk metric .
following de haro _
@xcite , it is convenient to consider the ( asymptotically ads ) bulk metric in fefferman   graham @xcite coordinates @xmath194\ , ,    \label{eq : feffermangraham}\ ] ] where @xmath195 here , the @xmath196 and @xmath197 are functions of the boundary coordinates @xmath198 , the logarithmic term only appears for even @xmath2 and powers of @xmath7 are exclusively even up to order @xmath1 . as shown in , the vacuum expectation value of the cft momentum tensor for @xmath21 dimensions
is then obtained from @xmath199 \right .
\nonumber \\     & & \left
.          \frac{1}{2 } \gamma_{(2)i}{}^m\gamma_{(2)jm }        + \frac{1}{4 } \gamma_{(2)ij } \gamma_{(2 ) }        \right\ } \,,\end{aligned}\ ] ] and @xmath200 is determined in terms of @xmath201 .
the dynamic freedom of the cft is thus encapsulated in the fourth   order term @xmath202 .
note that for @xmath203 , the metric ( [ eq : feffermangraham ] ) asymptotes to the ads metric in poincar coordinates ( [ eq : ads_poincare ] ) .
the relation between the gravitational and cft energy   momentum tensor for the case of global ads is discussed in ; see also .
many applications of the ads / cft correspondence are concerned with the equilibration of matter in heavy   ion collisions at the rhic or lhc and in particular its rapid thermalization @xcite . while the quark   gluon plasma generated in the collisions
is far from equilibrium at early stages , its behavior appears to be well described by hydrodynamics after time scales of the order @xmath204 .
this process is in principle governed by qcd but results indicate that many physical aspects can be studied in the framework of @xmath141 sym through the gauge   gravity duality .
small perturbations of a static system in thermal equilibrium are known to decay exponentially fast and correspond to quasi   normal modes on the gravity side @xcite and , as we shall discuss , numerical studies in the context of the ads / cft correspondence yield a similar picture for far   from equilibrium configurations .    the use of nr methods to study these processes in ads / cft has been pioneered by chesler & yaffe @xcite who evolve an anisotropic source on the ads boundary switched on after a short time using a characteristic approach based on ingoing eddington   finkelstein coordinates on the poincar patch of ads .
their numerical scheme is reduced to an effective `` 1 + 1 '' scheme by assuming boost invariance as well as rotational and translation symmetry in the transverse plane .
their boundary data generate gravitational waves which propagate into the bulk and lead to formation of a bh .
they extract the energy momentum tensor of the cft dual and follow the time evolution of the energy density as well as the transverse and longitudinal pressure components .
isotropization of the pressure occurs on time scales inversely proportional to the local temperature at the onset of the hydrodynamic regime which translates into an isotropization time of @xmath205 assuming a temperature of @xmath206 .
using the same setup , chesler & teaney @xcite use different definitions of a `` temperature '' based on the energy density and on two   point functions .
these two versions start agreeing after a time @xmath204 coincident with the isotropization of transverse and longitudinal pressure .
wu & romatschke @xcite employ a similar approach to collide two superposed shockwaves in a boost invariant approximation and find that the late   time behavior of the energy density is given by a hydrodynamic description involving a scale parameter determined by the initial apparent horizon area .
a comparison of the fully non   linear numerical results with predictions from the linearized close   limit approximation @xcite was performed by heller _
_ @xcite . instead of sourcing the anisotropy through a boundary term
, they prescribe anisotropic data on an initial null hypersurface extending through the bulk .
their results confirm the short isotropization times @xmath160 and find the linear approach to reproduce these values within @xmath207 even for large initial anisotropies .    a numerical scheme based on the adm formalism of the einstein equations
was developed by heller _
@xcite who emphasize that thermalization , when defined as the onset of the hydrodynamical regime , may differ from isotropization . by evolving boost   invariant ,
transversely homogeneous plasmas with various different initial conditions , they find that a hydrodynamic description may well be applicable when the pressure is still anisotropic .    in ref .
, chesler & yaffe relax their symmetry assumptions to translation invariance in the transverse direction which effectively constitutes a 2 + 1 numerical scheme .
their characteristic formulation works well in this scenario without showing any signs of formation of caustics and enables them to model heavy   ion collisions by colliding two shock waves .
specifically , they consider a single shock   wave solution in fefferman   graham coordinates , superpose two of those and transform the result to ingoing eddington   finkelstein coordinates . for stability purposes ,
they introduce a small energy offset on the cft side which generates an apparent horizon in the gravity dual above the poincar boundary to absorb steep gradients encountered in the metric functions deep in the bulk . by comparing the numerically determined pressure components with hydrodynamical predictions , they confirm the picture of rapid isotropization obtained in scenarios of higher symmetry .
translated into values for gold ion collisions at the rhic , they observe isotropization about @xmath208 after their shock waves start overlapping .    a numerical code based on cauchy type evolutions of asymptotically global ads spacetimes using the ghg scheme has been developed by bantilan _
_ @xcite . by assuming an @xmath209 symmetry , they reduce their computational domain to 2 + 1 dimensions .
initial data is specified in the form of a localized scalar field which promptly collapses to a bh with a highly distorted horizon and settles down to a stationary configuration through quasi   normal ringdown . whereas the lowest ringdown modes agree with linearized predictions , higher angular modes exhibit significant coupling due to non   linear effects .
the dual stress   energy tensor of the cft is mapped from the global @xmath210 ads boundary to a minkowski background and found to evolve in agreement with that of a thermalized sym fluid from the start of the simulations .
their work furthermore discusses in detail a number of regularization procedures required to obtain a numerically stable framework .    a very recent paper by adams _
@xcite presents a first numerical investigation of superfluid turbulence in 2 + 1 dimensions corresponding to a 3 + 1 dimensional asymptotically ads gravity dual .
they observe energy injected at long wavelengths to cascade down to short length scales , in contrast to the behavior of normal fluid turbulence in 2 + 1 dimensions .
the vast majority of the work reviewed here has been generated during the last four years ; nr in higher dimensions is a very young research field and likely has only scratched the surface of a wealth of possible applications .
nevertheless , a number of impressive results have demonstrated its vast potential .
discoveries such as the formation of naked singularities in black strings strengthen the belief that higher   dimensional gravity differs from its four   dimensional counterpart in more than a quantitative manner .
the same holds for the asymptotic structure of the spacetimes under consideration .
the instability of asymptotically anti   de sitter spacetimes to bh formation under arbitrarily small perturbations is in stark contrast to the stability of asymptotically flat or de sitter spacetimes@xcite .
one of the remarkable properties of higher   dimensional gravity is its connection with other areas of physics .
the holographic principle and the ads / cft correspondence in particular have opened a path towards understanding a variety of high   energy physics phenomena through the study of 4 + 1 gravity .
this facilitates direct contact with experiments such as heavy   ion collisions performed at the rhic . at the same time
, parton   parton collisions at tev energies at the lhc have provided for the first time a direct experimental test of the existence of extra dimensions .    in spite of the great success of nr in recent years , a great deal of work remains to be done .
numerical studies in @xmath2 dimensions have as yet been restricted to systems of considerable symmetry .
this is largely a consequence of computational requirements which increase enormously with each extra dimension .
continuous improvements of computer technology should , however , make possible in the foreseeable future the study of generic systems at least in @xmath22 , opening up a much wider class of problems in the context of the ads / cft correspondence and the stability analysis of bhs .    even within the context of symmetric systems
, many challenges are awaiting the community .
trans   planckian scattering is rather well   understood in @xmath21 .
connection with experiment , however , requires extension of these results to higher @xmath2 . here
, progress has been obstructed by stability issues of the numerical codes , calling for further investigation of the numerical formulations and gauge conditions .
many open questions also remain about the stability of bhs in higher dimensions . here
we note in particular that bhs are no longer restricted to spherical topology and even stationary multiple   bh solutions are known .
it is unclear how present numerical frameworks are able to handle black rings or saturns , although the relatively straightforward extension of nr studies to black strings may be encouraging .
numerical codes developed for the ads / cft correspondence have as yet been tailored to rather specific problems
. it would be desirable to have a generic framework effectively representing a numerical ads / cft laboratory . given the enormous range of bh systems in the context of the correspondence , this is likely going to be a tremendous challenge , albeit one of large scientific potential .
in summary , numerical relativity in higher dimensions is a highly active and rapidly growing field and it will be very exciting to see its development over the next years .

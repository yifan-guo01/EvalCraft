particle gels form in suspensions if short   range attractions act between contacting surfaces of particles . depending on the strength of the attraction
, one can distinguish them as two types : strongly and weakly aggregated particle gels  @xcite . in strongly aggregated particle gels , on which we focus in this work , particles once joined hardly separate at room temperature  @xcite .
the attractions also prevent tangential displacements of contacting particles  @xcite , thus particles form sample   spanning loose networks .
their remarkable and complex mechanical properties under external stress are essentially due to the response of a deformable disordered network formed with all the particles .    under shear stress
, one can sketch out deformation of a particle gel as follows  @xcite :    * the system is elastic under very low stresses .
if the stress is released , the system comes back to the original shape ; * for larger stress , a particle gel may undergo finite deformations , though it does not flow .
this is the plastic regime , and it gives malleability ; i.e. , the system mostly keeps the deformed shape if stress is released ; * beyond a yield stress , the particles network is ruptured and the particle gel flows .
fluids exhibiting these behavior are called _ yield stress _ ( or _ bingham plastic _ ) fluids  @xcite .
since the yield stress is the highest stress that can prevent flow , it can be considered as the strength of particle gels .
naturally , this strength relates to the strength of the particle connections . in a particle gel under shear stress ,
transmitting stresses break a portion of particle connections and the sample spanning network is torn apart .
the yield stress of particle gels is higher when the packing fraction of particles is larger . in many cases
, this variation appears to follow a power law with exponents between 4 and 5  @xcite .    under compressive stress ,
the behavior of a particle gel looks different , due to confinement  @xcite .
compressive stress appears naturally in a number of applications , for example paste drying  @xcite or ceramic processing  @xcite .
osmotic compression is a generic important case . in this kind of compression process
, liquid removal tends to pack the particles into a smaller volume .
as long as the applied stress is lower than the strength of the gel , it will retain the volume .
if the stress exceeds a compressive yield stress @xmath2 , network restructuring leads to the loss of a part of the liquid phase , and particles reorganize into a smaller volume  @xcite .
the deformation stops when the mechanical resistance of the network equals the stress .
thus , unlike the shear case , deformation does not continue with a constant applied stress  @xcite .
the growth of mechanical resistance , i.e. compressive consolidation , also shows a highly nonlinear dependence on the packing fraction , typically power   law relations @xmath3 with exponents between 3.2 and 4.5  @xcite .
the highly nonlinear dependency of the compressive yield stress @xmath2 on the packing fraction @xmath4 relates to the heterogeneity of the network structure of particles  @xcite .
the fractal model  @xcite successfully captures such packing   fraction dependence of rheological proprieties by considering the characteristic structure of strongly aggregated particle gels . in the model , a particle gel
is assumed to be an assembly of fractal flocssuch structural correlation is evidenced by scattering observations  @xcite .
the entire sample is filled up with flocs of a fractal dimension @xmath0 , and the correlation length @xmath1 is equivalent or proportional to the average size of the flocs .
thus , the correlation length @xmath1 can be associated with the packing fraction @xmath4 by using the fractal dimension @xmath0 : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the spatial dimension and proportional coefficient . under this assumption ,
a gel of a higher packing fraction consists of a higher number of smaller flocs of the same fractal dimension @xmath0 . by deducing average mechanical responses of the flocs ,
the fractal model predicts a power   law dependence of the shear modulus on @xmath4 with an exponent @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the fractal dimension of the backbone structure .
although this theoretical prediction has often been cited in the literature , we should pay attention to the scope of the model . since fractal correlation yields in the formation process of particle gels
, there is no clear reason for @xmath0 and @xmath9 to be kept constant during the compression process .
actually , some scattering observations indicate that the compression process changes the local structure ( fractal dimension )  @xcite . to make progress in macroscopic modeling of aggregated colloidal or particle gels  @xcite
, we need to settle such microstructural issues .
there is a recent two   dimensional(2d ) simulation work to support the application of the fractal model to compression processes  @xcite .
gels which were ( i ) directly prepared to the packing fraction @xmath4 , or ( ii ) prepared by compression from a lower packing   fraction gel @xmath10 showed the same structural characteristics . however , the investigated range of packing fractions was relatively high ( @xmath11 ) .
since the fractal model targets on strongly aggregated gels , we should compare simulations at lower packing fractions .
indeed , our 2d simulation investigates a wider range of packing fractions ( @xmath12 ) .
this article reports results of numerical simulation for compression of particulate networks to discuss the consolidation behavior with restructuring .
experimentally observed time evolution of compressed gels should be affected by both the hydrodynamic and network resistances  @xcite .
but , we here focus on studying the latter ; our simulation work investigates the quasi   static structural evolution determined by the balance between external stresses and network strength at long time .
this limitation to quasi   static aspects is common with the above   mentioned fractal model .
so , compression considered in this work is sufficiently slow , such as osmotic compression .
a contact model is employed to simulate sticky and breakable connections between contacting particles . in granular physics , there are many prior studies to investigate cohesive granular system  @xcite .
their simulation methods are an extension of the discrete element method  @xcite ; the rolling friction has been additionally included into the contact model .
though our target is a suspension system , the spirit of the modeling is almost the same . in granular physics , there are also some studies on compression of cohesive powders  @xcite , which obtained many common insights with our study .
2d simulation results are reported here .
one obvious benefit of studying 2d systems is easy recognition of the structure changes .
though the density   density correlation is an effective tool to capture special sorts of heterogeneous structures , it might not capture all features of random structures .
2d experimental system has also been studied to observe the microstructure change under shear  @xcite .
though we do not expect qualitative difference between 2d and 3d systems , this point should be checked by 3d simulation of the same modeling , which we hope to report in future work .
we use fractal aggregation models to generate the initial configurations . networks of particles are formed in a rectangle box of sides @xmath13 and @xmath14 with periodic boundary conditions .
we combine two processes .
the first step models a formation process of fractal clusters in the dilute limit ; the reaction   limited hierarchical cluster   cluster aggregation model was employed  @xcite .
each cluster consists of @xmath15 particles .
the second step is to build a network with them .
@xmath16 of the generated clusters are randomly placed in the box while avoiding overlap with each other , and then they are moved with a random walk .
collisions of clusters always lead to coalescence , so a single cluster is formed in the periodic boundary space after a while ( see , e.g. ,  [ fig_snapshots ]  ( a ) , below ) .
thus , we can generate random networks of a packing fraction @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the radius of a particle .
one can deduce structural features of the formed networks by evaluating the density   density correlation function @xmath19 ( see appendix [ appendix_density   correlation ] ) .
we prepared 10 samples of @xmath20 particles in a box @xmath21 .
the packing fraction is @xmath22 .
[ 223812_16oct12 ] shows the averages and standard deviations of their correlation functions @xmath19 .
a power   law decay of correlation is seen in the finite range @xmath23 .
the slope indicates fractal dimension @xmath24 , which is almost the same fractal dimension as the clusters generated by the aggregation model .
though a crossover behavior is seen in the range @xmath25 , the correlation decays out after that .     prepared in the box @xmath26 .
the averages and standard deviations were taken over 10 samples .
the red line indicates the slope corresponding to @xmath27 . ]
our contact model is designed to simulate strongly aggregated particle gels . the contact model used in the original discrete element method ( dem )  @xcite takes into account friction forces for the sliding mode , which is essential to simulate dense granular systems .
for cohesive granular systems , the rolling friction has been added  @xcite .
this extension is also required to reproduce the behavior of particle gels having chain   like local structures .
our implementation is similar to the model used for cohesive granular systems .
since the dynamic friction , which is modeled in typical contact models , is unclear for colloidal systems , this part is different in our model .
though a brief summary will be given below , the detailed descriptions of our implementation were given in another paper  @xcite .
we assume that interactions acting among particles are only short range forces .
no interparticle interaction acts between two particles before getting into contact .
once the gap between two particles becomes zero , a cohesive force starts to act between them . for simplicity ,
our simulation model assumes immediate bond generation , which is expected to give the upper limit of the consolidation behavior .
when compression   rate dependence is problem , the condition of bond generation can be crucial .
finite compression rates can suppress bond generation , leading to a weaker consolidation .
the forces and moments are assumed to be hookian : let us consider the contact interactions between particles @xmath28 and @xmath29 .
the center   to   center distance between them is @xmath30 , and the gap @xmath31 .
the normal ( separation / overlap ) displacement is related to the normal element of the contact force , @xmath32 where @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 otherwise .
@xmath36 is the normal unit vector defined by @xmath37 .
the second term of eq .   is added to avoid significant overlap between particles .
the sliding displacement @xmath38 relates to the tangential part of the contact force , @xmath39 the sliding displacement @xmath38 is the tangential projection of the deviation vector between the original contact points @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 where the vectors @xmath43 and @xmath44 indicate the original contact points from the respective centers of the particles and are fixed with them .
the bending angle @xmath45 ( @xmath46 is related to the moment acting on the rolling mode , @xmath47    these elastic relations are broken when the force or moment exceed threshold values .
we assume simple criteria given with three threshold values : the critical normal force @xmath48 , critical sliding force @xmath49 , and critical rolling moment @xmath50 .
when the pulling force exceeds the value ; @xmath51 , the bond is broken and the two particles separate . when the tangential force or rolling torque exceeds the threshold value ; @xmath52 or @xmath53 , both the sliding displacement @xmath54 and rolling angle @xmath55 are reset to zero , which releases the tangential parts of the stored energy .
the maximum strains are related to the threshold forces and moment as follows : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .
it must be noted that in our simple model the bond strength of the tangential mode does not depend on the normal load .
however , the enlarged contact area due to the normal load may change the tangential strengths  @xcite .
our neglect of this effect can affect simulations at higher packing fractions .
a particle @xmath28 may be in contact with other particles @xmath29 . the total contact force and torque acting on the particle @xmath28
can be written as follows : @xmath59 particles are immersed in a viscous fluid , so that hydrodynamic interactions also act on them . for micro or nano   sized particles ,
the particle reynolds number is extremely small , so the stokes equations should be used to evaluate the hydrodynamic interactions among many particles  @xcite . however , we do not go into the detailed hydrodynamics here .
hydrodynamic interactions in the stokes regime are scaled with the velocities of particles .
if the slow compression limit is considered , flows induced by particle movements are negligible in comparison with the contact forces .
they just work as energy dissipators .
indeed , some experimental observations suggest that a solvent flow does not contribute the rearrangements of particles in a slow sedimentation of colloidal gels  @xcite .    as an approximation ,
the stokes formula is used in this work ; the force and torque acting on a particle @xmath28 are proportional to the translational velocity @xmath60 and angular velocity @xmath61 , respectively : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the viscosity of the solvent . since the interparticle interactions are assumed to be sufficiently stronger than thermal agitations , brownian forces are also neglected in this work .
consequently , newton s equations of motions are given as the sum of the contact forces and hydrodynamic interactions , @xmath64 since particle inertia is very small for colloidal systems , it is a good approximation to neglect the inertia terms ( the left hand sides ) and solve the force balance equations  @xcite .
as explained later ( sect .
[ 141932_2nov12 ] ) , however , we took a different strategy to find the static equilibriums .
the compression is externally controlled . for simplicity ,
we focus on examining the uni   axial compression along the @xmath65 axis in this work .
the periodic boundaries at @xmath66 and @xmath67 of the simulation box introduced in section  [ sec_preparation_fractal_gel ] are replaced by two flat walls .
these walls can move along the @xmath65 axis like pistons , and they are assumed to be semipermeable ; liquid passes through them , while particles do not .
when particles get in contact with the walls , they are rigidly fixed there ; particles contacting with the wall move together as one object .
the periodic boundaries along the @xmath68 axis are still used during the compression simulation .
the stress   controlled compression , in which an external stress is applied to cause the compression , is similar to typical experimental situations , such as osmotic compression .
however , due to the higher efficiency of the simulation , we use strain   controlled compression .
this also allows us to have better statistics in our data .
this work investigates the slow compression limit ; the time scale of compression is much longer than the relaxation time of particle motions . in this case , the results obtained with the strain   controlled compression are essentially equivalent to the ones with the stress   controlled compression .
the compressive stress balancing the network resistance is evaluated from the total forces acting on the walls from particles .
since particles directly connecting to the walls ( called wall particles ) no longer have any mechanical freedom , the forces between wall particles @xmath28 and particles @xmath29 contacting with them are summed up as follows : @xmath69 when we refer to `` compressive stress '' in this 2d simulation work , our simulation box is assumed to have a thickness of particle diameter @xmath70 .
therefore , the compressive stresses are given as @xmath71 and @xmath72 .
our compression simulations are performed in a stepwise manner in order to obtain numbers of equilibriums by a single simulation run .
compression steps are given by two increment ratios @xmath73 and @xmath74 ; the initial compression from @xmath75 to @xmath76 is given as @xmath77 , and the @xmath78 th packing fraction as @xmath79 .
the increment ratio @xmath74 is determined with the number of steps @xmath80 from @xmath81 to @xmath82 : @xmath83 .
the strain   controlled compression is simply realized by translations of the walls with the velocity @xmath84 , so that the packing fraction increases continuously .
when it reaches a target packing fraction @xmath85 , the translations of the walls are suspended to await the equilibrium .
usually , the excess stress due to the quickness of the compression is relaxed by spreading the deformations into the entire system .
the following criteria are examined every @xmath86 time steps of the simulation :    * the relative difference between the top and bottom stresses is smaller than a threshold value @xmath87 : @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the average , @xmath90 . * the relative change of the compressive stress for the last @xmath91 steps is smaller than a threshold value @xmath92 : @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the one of @xmath86 steps before .
* no bonds were broken for the last @xmath86 steps .
thus , the compressive stress @xmath95 balancing the network of packing fraction @xmath85 can be determined .
once @xmath95 is determined , the compression continues again for the next target @xmath96 .      in order to reduce finite size effects
, the simulation box needs to involve a sufficient number of typical structures .
the compressive stress to balance sparse networks is very low , and the most of particles are slightly stressed . in this case , the relaxation time is significantly long . usually , the overdamped equations of motion , which are given by dropping the right hand sides of eqs .   due to the negligible inertia of particles , are used to simulate colloidal suspensions .
however , we have taken a different approach for efficiency . as restricting our scope in the slow compression
, we may be allowed to optimize some parameters for a faster simulation . in the slow compression limit ,
velocities of particles are also slow . in this case
, the contact forces dominate the displacements of particles .
this is why a reduced viscosity @xmath97 still leads to the same equilibrium configurations with a shorter time .
the following viscosity gives the critical damped motion in terms of the rolling mode .
@xmath98 though it is not simple problem to find the best value , we used @xmath99 in the equation of motion .
this arbitrary selection of the viscosity is justified only if the compression is considered slow enough .
this point will be checked in sect .
[ 141944_21nov12 ] .
the introduced 2d contact model ( see sect .  [ 112400_22dec12 ] ) is relatively simple , but it still has 7 parameters to be given .
traditional experimental measurements to characterize the particle   particle adhesion determine the pull   off force  @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath48 in this work . in recent years
the atomic force microscope became a reliable method , which provides more precise data for normal force   displacement relationships  @xcite .
however , there are fewer experimental measurements to determine the parameters of the other modes  @xcite .
the experimental measurement of the three   point bending test by using optical tweezers is remarkable  @xcite , which provides parameters for the rolling mode , @xmath50 and @xmath100 ( or @xmath101 ) . in any case , all parameters for a single system have never been determined so far .
thus our knowledge of the contact forces is still limited , so that we need to set the parameters by hand .
but , we may have a certain level of confidence by reproducing a similar bending behavior with the three   point bending measurements .
our selected parameters are intended to imitate the observed mechanical behavior : a small extent of elastic deformation and irreversible reorganization due to a critical moment .
we have selected two sets of the parameters called bond 1 and bond 2 , which are shown in  [ bond_parameters ] .
bond 1 has the same strengths for the three modes , while bond 2 is 5 times stronger for the normal and sliding mode than the rolling mode .
both have the same maximum strains ; elastic deformations give 5% of the radius .
12cmlccc & & bond 1 & bond 2 + normal strength & @xmath102 & 1 & 5 + sliding strength & @xmath103 & 1 & 5 + rolling strength & @xmath104 & 1 & 1 + normal strain & @xmath105 & 0.05 & 0.05 + sliding strain & @xmath106 & 0.05 & 0.05 + rolling strain & @xmath107 & 0.05 & 0.05 + parameter in eq .   & @xmath108 & @xmath109 & @xmath109 +    the simulation for the three   point bending test consists of the following three steps :    1 .
prepare a linear chain under no stress .
apply the forces @xmath110 at the central particle and @xmath111 at both the ends , and wait for equilibrium .
3 .   stop applying the forces , and wait for equilibrium .
the three snapshots i  iii in  [ fig_three   point   bending ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the configurations of the respective equilibriums of the bond 1 simulation .
though the data is not shown here , the results of bond 2 are similar .
the two results were obtained with two slightly different forces : ( a ) @xmath112 , ( b ) @xmath113 . if the external force did not reach the threshold , the initial linear shape remained after the test ( see ( a)iii ) . on the other hand ,
if the bond stress exceeded the threshold value , some irreversible rearrangement took place . as a result ,
the initial shape was not recovered ( see ( b)iii ) . in the latter case ,
the bending deformation proceeds until the moment acting on the broken bond becomes smaller than the threshold due to the increase of the bending angle .
this is why the small increment of the applied forces leads to the visible difference of the deformation ( see ii of ( a ) and ( b ) in  [ fig_three   point   bending ] ) .
the slight bending deformation seen by ( a)ii is close to the limit of elastic deformation of this cluster .
thus , the parameters were chosen to simulate some brittle behavior of colloidal aggregates ; the local structures remain unless bond breakups take place . in this test ,
the rolling mode of the contact model is responsible for the cluster s deformation .    )
is applied , the elastic deformation is seen ( a ) , and when it is slightly larger ( @xmath114 ) , the bond breakups cause the plastic deformation ( b ) . ]      the initial configurations ( sect .
[ sec_preparation_fractal_gel ] ) are fractal   like networks with a packing fraction @xmath115 , where @xmath26 and @xmath116 for bond 1 simulation . since the calculation cost of the bond 2 simulation is higher , smaller system size , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , is simulated . the first target packing fraction is set to @xmath119 .
the increment ratio and the number of compression steps are @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively .
the compression finally reaches to @xmath122 .
the relaxation time depends on the parameters of the bonds . to account for this ,
the wall velocities are set to @xmath123 and @xmath124 for the bond 1 and bond 2 simulations , respectively , where @xmath125 . in the equilibrium checks ( sect .
[ sec_uniaxial_compression ] ) after every @xmath126 time integration steps , @xmath127 is used for both the simulations , and @xmath128 and @xmath129 for bond 1 and for bond 2 simulations , respectively .      as explained in sect .
[ 141932_2nov12 ] , it is useful to introduce artificial parameters to speed up the compression simulation
. therefore we started to check that our method reproduced the quasi   static compression as expected .
if compression is too fast , the regions near the wall are easily crushed .
so , we examined the uniformity of the deformations along the compression axis .
the uniformity of compression can be seen via the @xmath65 dependence of the packing fraction @xmath130 , which is defined as the packing fraction in the sliced ranges : @xmath131 ( where @xmath132 was chosen ) . due to the heterogeneous structure and finite system size
, the uniformity can not be judged with a single compression simulation .
this is why we took the averages over 10 simulation runs with different initial configurations .
[ 232801_24oct12 ] shows the results for the bond 1 simulations , where every second compression step is plotted .
although we can see an undesirable drop at the middle of the first compression ( @xmath133 ) , the compression is satisfactorily uniform along @xmath65 axis after that .
the steep drops at both the edges relate to the integrity of the walls ; particles connecting to the walls are not allowed to move ( see section  [ sec_uniaxial_compression ] ) .
equivalent results were also obtained with the bond 2 simulation with a slower compaction speed ( see sect .
[ 100129_27dec12 ] ) .
dependence of packing fractions @xmath130 are shown for every second compression step ( @xmath134 , @xmath135 ) .
the solid line indicates the initial configuration . ]
once the system reaches a static equilibrium under a compressive stress @xmath89 , further compression requires a finite increment : @xmath136 .
therefore , the balancing stress @xmath89 can be considered as the strength of the gel network , i.e. , the _ compressive yield stress _
@xmath2  @xcite .
a simulation run of the stepwise compression ( sect .  [ 141932_2nov12 ] ) finds a series of @xmath2  _ vs. _  @xmath4 relations .
[ fig_compression_curves ] plots the results of the bond 1 and bond 2 simulations , where the unit of the stress is @xmath137 .
the compression from @xmath138 to @xmath139 shows wide ranges of @xmath2 ( about four decades ) .
these results indicate significantly rapid compressive   strain hardening .
is evaluated by the simulations of stepwise compression .
its averages and standard deviations taken over 10 runs are shown .
the red squares represent the result of the bond 1 simulations , and the blue circles of the bond 2 simulations .
the dotted curve shows the fitting function of eq .  , and
( solid and dashed ) straight lines show the power   law functions .
the arrows indicate ranges of the three regimes : ( i ) elastic   dominant regime , ( ii ) single   mode plastic regime , and ( iii ) multi   mode plastic regime .
the average exponents @xmath140 are written on the figure . ]
simulation provides various information , which allow us to understand the compression .
some of data indicate that there are three regimes in the compression process , which will be seen in the following section .
[ [ bond   creation ] ] bond creation + + + + + + + + + + + + +    bond creation is essential to understand the irreversible consolidation of the compression . due to heterogeneous structure of the networks ,
the compressive deformations are not affine .
consequently , two separated particles may come in contact and newly bond with each other .
the mean contact number per particle reflects new bond creations .
the result of bond 1 simulation is shown in  [ fig_contact_number_energy ]  ( a ) .
the compression continuously changes the value from 2 to about 4 with increasing rate , so we do not see distinct regimes in this .    .
the rates are obtained by normalizing with the compressive strain @xmath141 .
the averages and standard deviations are taken over 10 runs of the bond 1 simulation . ]
[ [ stored   and   dissipated   energies ] ] stored and dissipated energies + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the bonds have finite strength , and they can be broken up or irreversibly reorganized by certain applied stress .
such events cause the plastic deformation of the networks , which contribute the irreversibility .
the translations of the wall by external stress inject energy into the system .
part of the energy are stored in contact bonds first and dissipated as bond ruptures .
we can see this energy flow in the successive increments of the total stored and dissipated energies for each compression step  (  [ fig_contact_number_energy ]  ( b ) ) .
the total dissipated energy exceeds the total stored energy at the early stage , @xmath142 .
accordingly , we can identify the boundary of two regimes : elastic dominant regime ( i ) and plastic regime ( ii ) .
[ [ bond   rupture ] ] bond rupture + + + + + + + + + + + +    the accumulated numbers of the bond ruptures @xmath143 were recorded as distinguishing the stress modes causing the breakup , where the @xmath144 indicates ` connection break ' , ` sliding ' , or ` rolling ' .
the rupture rates @xmath145 can be defined as the number of breakups normalized with the total particle number and relative compressive strain : @xmath146  [ bond_ruptures ] shows the results of both the bond 1 and bond 2 simulations . at lower packing fractions , only rupture events occur due to rolling .
this indicates that compression of loose networks is achieved by bending deformations of particulate chains .
when the compaction reaches a certain point , further compression requires sliding or separation of contacting particles .
the onset of this mixed   rupture mode depends on the parameters of the contact forces .
the connection breaks start between @xmath147 and @xmath148 in bond 1 simulations , and between @xmath149 and @xmath150 in bond 2 simulations .
they split the plastic deformation into two parts : single   mode plastic regime ( ii ) below and multi   mode plastic regime ( iii ) above .
are compared for two types of bond : ( a ) bond 1 and ( b ) bond 2 .
the bond ruptures are recorded by the causing stress .
the rates of the separation due to normal forces are plotted by squares , the ones of the regeneration due to sliding forces or rolling moments by triangles and circles , respectively . ]
the date shown in the previous section indicate that three distinct behaviors can be recognized in the compression process .
let us discuss them one by one here .
[ [ i   elastic   dominant   regime ] ] ( i ) elastic dominant regime + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    there is no percolation path in the 10 initial configurations of @xmath151 ( see  [ fig_snapshots ] ( a ) ) .
hence , no compressive stress is required to compress them in the slow compression limit .
after some compaction , the first spanning path appears , and the network begins to resist the compressive stress . at the gel point , a single   linking chain ( percolation path ) resists the external stress between top and bottom .
this system   spanning cluster is deformed as a whole , so that strains of single bonds can be very small .
therefore , the dominant response to the external stress is elastic deformation ; the work by compression is stored in the contact bonds  ( see  [ fig_contact_number_energy ]  ( b ) ) . in this range ,
the power   law form expanding at the gel point @xmath152 is suitable to capture the @xmath2 @xmath4 curve  @xcite : @xmath153 in  [ fig_compression_curves ] , the dotted curve shows the fitting result with the function for the bond 1 simulation data of @xmath154 .
the fitting gives the extrapolated gel point as @xmath155 .
the evaluated exponent @xmath156 represents some nonlinearity .
the compression induces some new contacts , so that the numbers of percolation paths are increased .
the rise of resistance due to such increasing paths can be a plausible interpretation of the nonlinearity in this elastic   dominant regime .
it must be noted that our simulation results in this range might have large statistical fluctuations .
the typical length scale of the structure is comparable to the system size ( compare the drawn circle and the box size in  [ fig_snapshots ]  ( a ) ) , and consequently only a few paths enter the averaging .
therefore , the gel point @xmath152 obtained in the above fitting has only limited significance .
[ [ ii   single   mode   plastic   regime ] ] ( ii ) single   mode plastic regime + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    by considering two data (  [ fig_contact_number_energy ]  ( b ) and  [ bond_ruptures ] ) , we identified the single   mode plastic regime in the ranges : @xmath157 for bond 1 simulations and @xmath158 for bond 2 simulations .
this @xmath4 dependence of the consolidation behavior has been discussed with a scaling concept  @xcite .
the power   law relationships of @xmath2 and @xmath4 have been also observed in experiments  @xcite : @xmath159 a similar power   law behavior can be seen in our simulation results (  [ fig_compression_curves ] ) .
the least squares fitting gives the almost same exponents : @xmath160 and @xmath161 , for the bond 1 and bond 2 results , respectively .
let us look more closely at this regime .
[ fig_snapshots ] ( b ) shows the configuration of particles at the beginning of this range ( @xmath162 ) in a bond 1 simulation . at the gel point ,
a single linking path spanned the entire box .
in contrast , multi   linking structures span the system here . since the maximum bending moment of a random   walk chain is proportional to the inverse of the chain size , the supportable loads of larger loops are smaller .
the variety of the mesh sizes indicates a heterogeneity of the local strengths .
though large empty spaces remain , the relatively dense meshes fill the space from the bottom to the top (  [ fig_snapshots ]  ( b ) ) .
further compression requires destroying a part of them . as shown in  [ bond_ruptures ] , the rolling   mode ruptures are the only rupture events seen in this range .
therefore , the size of the responsible mesh structures determines the compressive yield stress @xmath2 .
thus , in the single   mode plastic regime , the length scale is essential ; the compression breaks larger and weaker structures into smaller and more robust structures .
fractal model was employed to give the length scale from the packing fraction  @xcite ( see sect .  [ sec_structure_compression ] ) . according to the nature of a fractal ,
a portion of a fractal cluster is also a small fractal cluster .
if the compression of fractal networks causes only fragmentation of fractal clusters into smaller pieces , it can be expected that the correlation length is decreased while keeping the same fractal dimension .
this optimistic expectation leads us to employ the fractal model for the compression problem .
we will check this point in the next section .    , whose packing fraction is @xmath22 .
the configurations ( b ) and ( c ) show the beginning of the _ single   mode plastic regime _ ( @xmath162 ) and the _ multi   mode plastic regime _ ( @xmath163 ) , respectively , and ( d ) shows @xmath164 .
the red circles express the correlation lengths ; their diameters are @xmath165 , which will be evaluated in the later section ( sect .
[ sec_structure_compression ] ) . ]
[ [ iii   multi   mode   plastic   regime ] ] ( iii ) multi   mode plastic regime + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the onset of connection breaks indicates that the compression enters a new regime .
this transition point depends on the parameters of the bonds .
we consider the data above @xmath163 and @xmath166 in bond 1 and 2 simulations as the multi   mode plastic regime . in these ranges ,
the compression curves look to follow a power law .
however , the evaluated exponents are totally different with each other : @xmath167 and @xmath168 .
it is by chance that the exponent of bond 2 simulations is similar with the one in the single   mode plastic regime .
the exponent in this regime is easily affected by the parameters of the contact model , that implies absence of a simple scaling law .
[ fig_snapshots ] ( c ) depicts the beginning of this regime of a bond 1 simulation ( @xmath163 ) .
there are still large loops remaining , but they look like voids due to the denser surroundings . here , we can easily find dense meshes and trimers ( a trimer can be considered as the building block of a close packing ) .
if they are next to each other , the entire object can be considered as a lump .
the same scenario of the _ single   mode plastic regime _ seems to work ; denser mesh domains are piled up over the entire system .
however , due to the finite size of particles , the mechanical response of denser meshes is not the same as looser ones .
the crush of them involves sliding ruptures and connection breaks , which are seen in  [ bond_ruptures ] .
since the criteria of destruction includes the all three modes , the compression curve depends on the details of the contact force .
this regime terminates due to the close packing , where rigidity of particles prevents reorganizations of particles . since
our simplified contact model is not accurate for that , we can not specify the upper end of the range .      during compression
, separated particles can newly come into contact .
consequently , mesh size decreases as @xmath4 is increased by compression .
if we employ the fractal model  @xcite to explain the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath2 , the structure change needs to follow a special manner ; the fractal dimension @xmath0 characterizing the local structures does not depend on the packing fraction @xmath4 , and the correlation length @xmath1 is a decreasing function of the packing fraction @xmath4 , @xmath169 .
the fractal dimension @xmath0 can be estimated from the density   density correlation function @xmath19 ( see  [ appendix_density   correlation ] ) .
[ fig_ddc ] shows averages of the correlation functions @xmath19 of every second compression step , @xmath134 ( @xmath170 ) , of the bond 1 simulation results .
the results of the bond 2 simulations were almost the same .
the correlation of the density is mostly decreasing functions of the two   point distance @xmath171 .
the correlation of the configuration before compression is the largest and reaches the farthest distance ( solid line ) .
the compression reduces this correlation in a continuous manner .     of compressed networks
are shown .
the solid line shows the initial configuration @xmath172 , and the dashed or dotted lines the every second compression step @xmath134 ( @xmath173 ) . they are averaged values over 10 runs of simulations . ]
the fractal correlation appears as a straight slope in the log   log plot of @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath174 .
though the straight lines can be recognized in the initial configuration , the compressed networks show slightly curved lines . in order to make them easier to see ,
we introduce the fractal dimension profile @xmath175 from the local slope of the correlation function at each distance @xmath171 : @xmath176 the results are shown in  [ 143513_26nov12 ]  ( a ) . as mentioned in sect .
[ sec_preparation_fractal_gel ] , the initial configurations ( solid line ) consist of three parts : a fractal plateau ( @xmath177 ) indicating @xmath178 , crossover range ( @xmath179 ) , and 2d   like uniform network ( @xmath180 ) .
thus , though the recognizable fractal plateau is limited , the @xmath175 profiles of the initial configurations agree with the expected behavior as fractal networks .     evaluated by eq .
are plotted .
the solid line shows the initial configuration @xmath172 , and the dashed or dotted solid lines the every second compression step @xmath134 ( @xmath173 ) .
the numerical values indicate the packing fractions .
( b ) the @xmath4 dependence of the correlation length @xmath181 ( see the definition in the text ) . ]
once the networks are compressed , the fractal correlations are affected immediately .
indeed , the first compression step of our simulation ( @xmath182 ) shows the entire change of @xmath175 : a narrower plateau indicating a rise of the fractal dimension , and shifts of the crossover and uniform ranges to shorter lengths .
these results suggest that not only long   distance correlations , but short   distance correlations can be affected by the compressive deformation at the early stage .
this tendency continues for the further compression .
though the profiles @xmath175 for the compressed networks indicate that mono   fractal assumption does not work , it may be worth determining the @xmath4 dependence of the correlation length @xmath1 .
since the slopes of @xmath19 in  [ fig_ddc ] are not constant , it is ambiguous to determine @xmath1 from them . in our purpose
, we may consider the correlation length as the length scale where the network looks uniform .
the typical length scale for the uniformity can be determined by evaluating fluctuation of local densities  @xcite .
the local densities are defined by boxes of size @xmath183 , which are denoted by @xmath184 .
if the size of box is larger than the correlation length @xmath1 , the local densities show little fluctuation ; the system looks uniform .
thus , the standard deviation of the local densities normalized by the global density , @xmath185 , measures the uniformity . due to the finite system size
, we compare here the lengths showing a common finite fluctuation , @xmath186 .
the actual values of the correlation lengths @xmath1 should be larger than the evaluated lengths @xmath187 , so a common arbitrary factor may be given to adjust .
[ 143513_26nov12 ]  ( b ) shows the result of the lengths @xmath187 satisfying @xmath188 .
we find a power   law relation between @xmath1 and @xmath4 with an exponent @xmath189 .
the obtained exponent is a little bit smaller than the fractal assumption : @xmath190 .
the evaluated correlation lengths , @xmath191 , are also shown as the diameter of the circles drawn in  [ fig_snapshots ] .
we focused on investigating compression of particle gels . inspired by scaling theory for polymer gels ,
the fractal model has been introduced to explain the packing fraction dependence of particle gels rheology  @xcite , and referred for the compression process  @xcite .
the model assumes that the structure of a particle gel is fractal network .
however , the simple question whether a particle gel under compression is fractal network or not , has left unanswered .
we have aimed to answer this question by introducing a particle   scale simulation model in the limit of strongly aggregated particle gels . in this case , the cohesive force among contacting particles is assumed to be so strong that brownian forces do not affect the structural evolution of gels .
our simulation reproduced the reasonable consolidation behaviors as @xmath4 _
vs_.  @xmath2 relationships in the case of quasi   static compression . by
monitoring various particle   scale information , i.e. , mean contact number , stored / dissipated energy , and number of bond ruptures , we identified the three distinct regimes : ( i ) elastic dominant regime , ( ii ) single   mode plastic regime , and ( iii ) multi   mode plastic regime . at the gel point , there are many `` dead end '' branches , where the particles in such branches do not contribute to the strength of the network @xmath2 .
compression makes separated particles come into contact , so that the mesh size becomes smaller and smaller .
this explanation is already known and qualitatively true for the most part .
such shrinkage of the typical length scale causes a transition of the local mechanical response from ( ii ) to ( iii ) in the plastic regimes .
while the length scale is large enough , the rolling mode is the responsible for the deformation . at a certain length scale ,
the sliding and normal modes become more important for further compression .
thus , we confirmed that a single regime could never cover the wide range of packing fractions in spite of subtle appearance in the @xmath4 _
vs_.  @xmath2 relationships .
the simulation results also provided an insight that heterogeneity in the local mesh sizes plays some roles in the way of reorganization under compression and overall network strength .
mechanical correlations ( connectivity ) determine which parts of the network are destroyed under an applied stress .
if a percolation path consisting of robust domains is built , they support a large fraction of the applied stress . in this case , the weakest domain in the path is most probable to be destroyed .
this restructuring yields a smaller and robuster domain , which results in the reinforcement of the percolation path .
however , such mechanism is subtle because compression is not continuing deformation and tends to reduce the heterogeneity .    in order to see whether the fractal assumption remains or not in particle gels under compression
, we evaluated the density   density correlation @xmath19 for the simulation results .
the evaluated fractal dimension profile @xmath175 says that compression affects both the local structure and correlation length in the early stage .
thus , our results are contradictory to the application of the fractal model to compression processes .
however , the fractal dimension profiles @xmath175 show a systematic change in the _ single   mode plastic regime_. this result seems to indicate required ingredients to upgrade the fractal model for compression processes .
the simulation model of this work is simple ; we neglect various factors in real particle gels to make clear the focus of study and to optimize the simulation speed in order to achieve large system sizes . for example
, we employed a simple contact model , which depends on only configuration of particles and has no history dependence
. however , cohesion between particles in real system may be more complex , e.g. the bonding or breakup may require certain time periods . in order to deal with such systems ,
our quasi   static simulation framework needs to be extended .
this extension is relevant for the future work because there are many experimental works investigating on the time / rate   depending aspects of colloidal gels and yield stress fluids  @xcite .
the authors would like to thank prof .
morton denn for valuable suggestions on the manuscript , and rs would like to express his gratitude to prof .
richard buscall for fruitful discussions , valuable suggestions , and warm encouragement .
in order to study colloidal gels , we need to have some tools to characterize random structured systems .
the density   density correlation function @xmath192 is used for this purpose .
the local density function @xmath193 is defined as follows : @xmath194 by taking the average over the entire space of the system , the density   density correlation function @xmath192 is defined as follows : @xmath195 when the system is isotropic , the correlation is given in terms of the distance , @xmath196 , which can be obtained by taking averages over all directions : @xmath197 the correlation function @xmath19 can be regarded as a conditional probability to find particles .
since it is normalized by the entire probability , the value 1 means no correlation .
it is known that strongly aggregated gels have structures involving fractal correlations .
the local structures are equivalent to fractal flocs . for fractal flocs , the relation between the number of particles @xmath198 and the radius of gyration @xmath199 follows a power   law : @xmath200 the exponent @xmath0 is called fractal dimension .
therefore , the average packing   fraction profile of the clusters is given as follows : @xmath201 where @xmath171 is the distance from the center of mass . since
fractal gels can be considered as cluster   filling networks , the local structure should coincide with this density profile .
consequently , the density   density correlation function @xmath19 has the same functional form : @xmath202 . in a fractal gel ,
the correlation reaches a finite distance , which is called the correlation length @xmath1 . for @xmath203
, the correlation does not remain : @xmath204 if the local densities are evaluated in boxes of size @xmath1 , the system should look uniform .

progress in the technology of group - iii nitrides , discovery of unique material properties and perspectives of high - power , and high - frequency applications  @xcite have inspired studies of high - field transport regimes in these materials  @xcite , including the high - frequency phenomena  @xcite .
most of these studies were focused to very high electric fields ( @xmath2 ) , where the intervalley electron transfer and the gunn effects are expected .
also there is a necessity of understanding of hot electron kinetics in the range of moderate electric fields ( @xmath3 ) , because of fundamental and practical importance of such a case .
indeed , it is believed ( see recent review  @xcite ) that in polar nitride materials subjected to a moderately high electric field , strong inelastic optical phonon scattering can provide the so - called streaming transport regime .
the latter is characterized by considerable anisotropy of electron distribution in the momentum space , quasi - saturation of the current - field dependence , negative dynamic conductivity and other useful effects .    in general ,
the following conditions are favorable to realize the streaming regime : ( i ) strong electron - optical phonon coupling , ( ii ) low temperatures which provide optical phonon emission as dominant scattering mechanism of hot electrons and ( iii ) relatively low electron concentrations , when e - e scattering is negligible . according to the analysis given in a number of the works  @xcite ,
these conditions can be met in the nitride materials , as well as in the nitride heterostructures  @xcite . at the streaming regime ,
the electron motion is nearly periodic : in an appropriate range of the _ dc _ electric field , an electron accelerates quasiballistically until it reaches the optical phonon energy , then the electron loses its energy by emitting an optical phonon and starts the next period of acceleration .
such a mechanism of the nearly periodic electron motion leads to electric field induced resonances in high - frequency conductivity [ the so - called optical phonon transient time resonance ( opttr ) ]  @xcite .
the opttr provides an operating principle for electrically pumped semiconductor sub - thz and thz sources  @xcite , that has been practically realized in n - inp crystals  @xcite .    experimental observation of the opttr in the nitrides and its further device implementation is impeded by the deficit of electron transport data for the range of moderate electric fields , including high - frequency properties .
additional useful information on properties of the nitrides can be obtained by investigation of magnetic field effects on charge carriers , for example , investigation of the electron cyclotron resonance ( cr ) .
it is well known , that exploitation of the cr is a powerful spectroscopic method that allows to determine important parameters of the band structure and carrier dynamics ( for a detail review see ref .
@xcite ) . monitoring the cyclotron resonance in an electric field ,
one can study intraband dynamic processes of nonequilibrium carriers .
for example , the cyclotron resonance technique was successfully used to study _ hot electrons and holes _ in ge  @xcite , si  @xcite , insb  @xcite , gaas  @xcite and other important semiconductor materials . as the result
, the detailed features of hot carrier kinetics have been understood .
these include : relaxation mechanisms and their parameters , character of carrier distribution in the momentum space , the dynamic conductivity , etc .
recently , the cyclotron resonance was observed in the nitrides at moderate and high magnetic fields ( above 5 tesla ) . here
the resonance became apparent in thz - frequency range  @xcite , because of small sub - picosecond relaxation times characteristic for the nitrides .    in this paper by the use of the monte - carlo method , we study gan bulk - like material in moderate electric and magnetic fields .
we focus on high - frequency response of gan under conditions , when both resonances , the cr and the opttr , become apparent simultaneously .
we show that overlapping of the two resonances produces specific spectra of thz transmission and reflection , as well as characteristic polarization effects .
we consider a bulk gan sample of the cubic modification with a given concentration of ionized impurity , @xmath4 . to exclude quenching effect on the opttr by electron - electron scattering
we suppose that the sample is compensated , thus the electron concentration @xmath5 . at electric fields of a moderate strength ,
all electrons remain in the @xmath6 valley and can be characterized by the parabolic dispersion law with the effective mass , @xmath7 .
the @xmath8 electric field , @xmath9 , and the magnetic field , @xmath10 , are assumed to be parallel .
let the both fields be directed along @xmath11 axis , @xmath12 .
the magnetic field is treated as a classical one .
the @xmath13 electric field is supposed to be harmonic , @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the frequency . to find the small - signal response ,
the @xmath13 field is considered as a small perturbation , @xmath16 .    to calculate electron transport characteristics and , particularly , frequency dependent dynamic mobility , @xmath17
, we use the single - particle algorithm of the monte - carlo procedure  @xcite . for the simulation of the electron transport
we take into account the main three scattering mechanism : scattering by ionized impurities , acoustic phonons and polar - optical phonons . for the ionized impurity scattering ,
we exploit the `` mixed '' scattering model that unifies both brooks - herring and conwell - weisskopf approaches .
this approach is more appropriate for the analysis of compensated materials .
the formulae of electron scattering probabilities for these mechanisms can be found in ref .
@xcite .    in the limit of a classical magnetic field
the scattering probabilities do not depend on this field .
however , the magnetic field determines the lorentz force , so that electron dynamics between sequential collisions is described by the equation : @xmath18 \right ] , \label{eq}\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the electron velocity , @xmath20 is the elementary charge , @xmath21 is the light velocity . to avoid cumbersome expressions for @xmath22 during free flight between collisions we present here only velocity modulation by the
field , @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an initial moment , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the cyclotron frequency .
we used eqs .
( [ eq ] ) and ( [ eq1 ] ) to apply the monte - carlo procedure to the steady - state kinetics and high - frequency response of the electron gas subjected to both electric and magnetic fields  @xcite .
first , we studied the steady - state distribution function of hot - electrons , the drift velocity , @xmath28 , the average energy , @xmath29 , and other stationary electron characteristics in wide range of applied @xmath8 electric fields , when the magnetic field , @xmath30 is present . in fig.[fig0 ] we show an example of calculations of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and distribution function .
these results are discussed below in more details .    for the magnetic fields of a moderate strength ( @xmath31 )
, we found that these characteristics practically are independent on the magnetic field .
this is a consequence of two main factors : ( i ) for the parabolic electron dispersion and the parallel configuration of electric and magnetic fields , electron motion along fields direction and that in perpendicular plane are uncoupled ; ( ii ) the magnetic field does not affect the energy balance of the electron system .
the detail analysis of the steady - state transport characteristics in compensated gan can be found in ref .
@xcite .    in the presence of steady - state electric and magnetic fields ,
the high - frequency response can be characterized by the dynamical mobility , which is the tensor , @xmath32 .
the dynamic mobility tensor defines the @xmath13 electric current induced by the @xmath13 field , @xmath33 . for the considered configuration of the fields , this tensor has five non - zero components : @xmath34 where only three components , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , are linearly independent .
other components are @xmath38 , @xmath39 .
note , at @xmath40 nondiagonal components are equal to zero . in next section
we present the analysis of spectra of all components of @xmath17 and their dependencies on the electric and magnetic fields .
prior to discussion of results on the hot - electron dynamical mobility , @xmath41 , we shall estimate ranges of the parameters favorable for observation of the opttr and the cr effects in gan .    for concentrations of the electrons and ionized impurities we set @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath43 , respectively .
the lattice temperature is assumed to be 30 k. for the gan material parameters , such as effective mass , dielectric constants , deformation potential , etc , we used the database from ref .
@xcite the low field mobility was calculated to be @xmath45 , which is well correlated with the measured mobility in gan samples of low dislocation density  @xcite .
for these parameters , the streaming transport regime and the opttr are the most pronounced in the range of the @xmath8 electric fields @xmath46 . as seen from fig .
( a ) , in this range of applied @xmath8 electric fields the drift velocity and the averaged energy show the typical quasisaturation behavior . as the results of streaming electron motion , the strongly asymmetric electron distribution function is formed in momentum space . in figs .
[ fig0 ] ( b ) and ( c ) , we present both longitudinal and transversal profiles of the distribution function for the case of developed streaming , @xmath47 .
as seen , the transversal profile of the distribution function remains symmetric . while for the longitudinal one shows strong asymmetry : the electrons have momenta mainly directed along the applied force .
the streaming distribution leads to the effect of opttr in the frequency range @xmath48  @xcite .
classical treatment of electron motion in the magnetic field requires the condition @xmath49 . for the above range of the electric field ,
the average hot electron energy in gan is estimated to be @xmath50 .
then , the latter inequality gives limitations : @xmath51 thz and @xmath52 t. in what follows , we restricted ourself to the analysis of moderate magnetic fields , @xmath53 , which correspond to the cyclotron frequency @xmath54 .      a representative example of the dynamic mobility of hot electrons under the developed streaming regime ( @xmath55 ) is given in fig .
the magnetic field is set to be @xmath56 . in this figure , three independent tensor components , @xmath57 ,
are shown as functions of the frequency , @xmath15 .
the longitudinal ( with respect to the applied fields ) component , @xmath58 , is practically independent on the magnetic field and demonstrates all signs of the opttr effect : an oscillation behavior of both @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath60 $ ] , and a frequency `` window '' , where the real part of the dynamic mobility is negative , @xmath59 < 0 $ ] . minimum of @xmath59 $ ] reaches the value @xmath61 at @xmath62 .
notice , absolute values of @xmath59 $ ] including the case @xmath63 are much smaller than the low field mobility . this is a consequence of above mentioned quasi - saturation of the velocity - field characteristics .
the transverse component , @xmath64 , and off - diagonal component , @xmath65 , are dependent on both @xmath66 fields and demonstrate features proper to the cr .
the maximum of @xmath67 $ ] and zero of @xmath60 $ ] occur at @xmath68 , @xmath69 for the used parameters . in the vicinity of @xmath70
, we find that @xmath67 $ ] is considerably larger than @xmath71|$ ] .
this is because all electrons contribute to the cr , while exclusively streaming electrons contribute to the opttr effect .
we found that spectral dependencies of two tensor components , @xmath72 , can be approximately described by the simple drude - lorentz model that takes into account electron motion in a magnetic field .
for this model , the components are @xmath73 where @xmath74 is an effective relaxation time . as seen from figures  [ fig1 ] ( b ) and ( c ) , eqs .
( [ drude ] ) give a good fitting to the monte carlo result for @xmath75 .
herewith , the cr is well pronounced , because @xmath76 .      for the analyzed configuration of @xmath77 and @xmath30 fields , the electric field does not affect the cyclotron motion of the electrons in the @xmath78-plane .
instead , this field modifies the electron distribution and alters relaxation processes , and , consequently , the effective relaxation time , @xmath74 .    the results presented in fig .
[ fig2 ] illustrate the electric field effect on the cyclotron resonance .
one can see that , when the @xmath77 field varies , the frequency of the resonance remains equal to @xmath70 , while the sharpness of the resonance degrades considerably with increase of the @xmath77 field magnitude .
for example , at @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) the cyclotron peak in @xmath81 $ ] practically disappears when @xmath82 ( see fig .  [ fig2](a ) ) .
this is , obviously , due to an intensification of scattering processes . for the larger magnetic field , @xmath83 ,
the cr remains observable for the range @xmath84 , as shown in fig .
[ fig2](b ) .
therein we present also the @xmath77 field dependence of the effective relaxation time , @xmath74 , found by fitting eqs .
[ drude ] to the monte - carlo results .
it is interesting , that for the @xmath77 field range , @xmath85 , when the streaming regime is formed , @xmath86 dependence qualitatively correlates with the transit - time , @xmath87 , during which a ballistically accelerated electron reaches the optical phonon energy , @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89 .
thus under very fast process of optical phonon emission , the width of the cr is determined rather by the dynamic characteristic , @xmath87 .
to measure microwave / optical effects in a magnetic field one uses , typically , the faraday and/or voigt configurations of an incident wave and a magnetic field . the cr can be observed for both configurations , while the opttr can be measured only for the voigt configuration ( if @xmath90 and @xmath91 fields are parallel ) . to study coexistence and interplay of both resonant effects
we will focus on the _ voigt configuration_.    for certainty , we set that the incident electromagnetic wave propagates along the oy axis and the high - frequency electric field , @xmath92 , lies in the @xmath93-plane .
the incident wave is supposed to be linearly polarized .
then , for the wave polarization along the @xmath94 axis ( @xmath95 ) the cr is observable , but the opttr is absent . to the contrary , for the wave polarization along the @xmath11 axis ( @xmath96 )
the cr is missed , but the opttr appears . for other polarizations ,
both resonances coexist and affect each other .
interplay of the two resonances becomes apparent , for example , in transmission spectra .
these spectra comprise two contributions from electron and lattice subsystems . in additions , the spectra vary with the sample thickness because of reflection and interference effects . in fig .
[ fig3](a ) , we show the transmission spectra of a gan sample in the thz frequency range , where the cr and the opttr appear . the electron parameters and magnitudes of the @xmath77 , @xmath30 fields are the same as in fig .
the sample thickness is set @xmath97 , the dielectric permittivity is @xmath98 . for comparison ,
the contribution of the lattice subsystem is shown separately . in accordance with the above
said , the transmission spectra depend on the polarization of the incident wave .
for the polarization parallel to the @xmath77 , @xmath30 fields , the cr is absent , however due to the opttr the electron contribution leads to an increase in the transmission coefficient ( curve 1 ) . for the perpendicular polarization ,
the cr decreases the transmission ( curve 3 ) , while there is no the opttr contribution .
the transmission spectra for an intermediate polarization are illustrated by curve 3 .    in fig .
[ fig3](b ) , we present frequency dependencies of the loss / gain coefficients which append the data in fig .
[ fig3](a ) .
the loss / gain coefficient defines decrease / increase of the electromagnetic wave energy per unit time due to interaction with the electrons in the gan sample .
one can see that characteristic for the cr decrease in the transmission coefficient is due to cyclotron absorption , while sample bleaching under opttr is relevant to a gain of the electromagnetic wave .
the loss / gain effects and their dependencies on the wave polarization can be analyzed as follows .
let @xmath99 be an angle between the electric vector @xmath100 and the @xmath11 axis .
then , the time - averaged @xmath13 power density , that is received by electrons from the electromagnetic wave , reads : @xmath101   |\bf{f}_{\omega}|^2\ , .
\label{power}\ ] ] a negative value of @xmath102 indicates that an energy is transferred from the electrons to the electromagnetic field and vice - versa , a positive @xmath102 means that the energy of the wave is absorbed by the electron subsystem .    in the frequency window , where @xmath59 < 0 $ ] , the function @xmath103 can be negative in some interval of
the polarization angles @xmath99 .
the condition @xmath104 restricts the parameters @xmath105 , where the gain due to the opttr occurs .
the actual space of these parameters can be illustrated in the @xmath106-plane , as presented in fig .
[ fig4 ] for different values of the @xmath30 field . from this figure
it is seen that for @xmath107 the gain occurs in the sufficiently wide angle sector , @xmath108 . with increasing @xmath30
this angle sector becomes narrow .
for example , at @xmath109 the gain is possible only at @xmath110 .
thus , polarization dependencies of the gain effect are strongly affected by the cr .
in this paper , we have investigated bulk - like gan subjected to electric and magnetic fields of moderate magnitudes , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively . the parallel configuration of the electric and magnetic fields has been assumed . with the use of the monte carlo method , we have calculated steady state and high - frequency characteristics of the compensated gan at low temperatures .
particularly , we have focused on the situation , when two resonances , the cyclotron resonance and the optical phonon transient - time resonance , become apparent simultaneously
. we have calculated spectral dependencies of all components of the tensor of dynamical mobility in thz frequency range for different magnitudes of the electric and magnetic fields .
we have studied the cr for hot electrons , particularly , the electric field dependence of the cr broadening . for the analyzed range of the electric fields , where the streaming transport regime and the opttr effect are realized
, we have found that the effective relaxation time , @xmath86 , determinative the broadening , correlates with the transit - time , @xmath87 , during which a ballistically accelerated electron reaches the energy of the optical phonon .
that is , at very fast process of optical phonon emission , the cr broadening is determined rather by the dynamic characteristic , @xmath87 .
we have determined spectral and field dependencies of the opttr .
then , we have found that at electric fields of a few @xmath0 and magnetic fields of a few @xmath1 , well - developed cyclotron effect and optical phonon transient - time effects may coexist in the frequency range of @xmath113 : they can be observed simultaneously for the voigt configuration of the incident thz wave and the fields .
we have shown that interplay of two resonances gives rise to specific spectra of thz transmission and absorption ( or gain ) , as well as characteristic polarization effects .
it is important to make a few remarks on experimental observation of the discussed effects in the thz frequency range .
the spectral measurements in the thz range can be performed by using recently developed _ detection methods _ for ultrashort electric signals and _ generation techniques _ for sub - picosecond transients of electric fields .
the advanced ultrafast detection methods mainly relay on two techniques : photoconductive sampling  @xcite and electro - optic sampling  @xcite . by the use of femtosecond laser pulses with high repetition rates , these techniques allow for the direct measurement of electric transients with sub - picosecond time resolution . as for the generation techniques of sub - picosecond electric field transients ,
the most studied are thz pulses emitted by transient photocurrents in a photoconductive switch and thz emission generated by nonlinear optical processes ( optical rectification , four - wave mixing , etc ) .
additionally , time - resolved thz polarization and ellipsometry methods are available .
the techniques of generation and detection of sub - picosecond electric field transients were applied to gan films to measure real and imaginary parts of the small signal conductivity under equilibrium conditions  @xcite .
apparently , the discussed thz techniques are generally compatible with high - field measurement set - ups for magnetotransport in gan films / plates .
particularly , these techniques can be applied to study the cr and opttr for the most interesting voigt configuration of the fields .
concluding , the presented results show that low temperature investigation of gan samples in moderate electric and magnetic fields can provide a useful information on hot electron dynamic and relaxation , as well as reveal novel high frequency effects .
we suggest that experimental investigation of these effects would facilitate elaboration of field controlled devices for thz optoelectronics , including thz emitters , amplifiers , electro - optical modulators  @xcite , etc .

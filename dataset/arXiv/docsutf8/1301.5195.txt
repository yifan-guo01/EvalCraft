since the first claim of hemispherical power asymmetry in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies @xcite as measured by the wmap satellite in its first - year observation , a growing number of papers on the subject have appeared in the literature .
further investigations have refined the analysis and extended it to wmap 3- and 5-year data @xcite , leading to confirmation of a hemispherical power asymmetry - defined by galactic coordinates @xmath0 - in the multipole range @xmath1 $ ] , whose significance is as high a @xmath2 @xcite .    as an alternative to a discontinuous change of the power on two opposed hemispheres ,
a dipolar modulation has also been considered , in the literature . in @xcite
the data resolution is lowered and a modulation of the cmb signal is assumed for angular scales up to a maximum multipole considered , @xmath3 . instead ,
@xcite proposed the use of an optimal quadratic estimator on full - resolution data , finding mild evidence for a dipolar modulation at large angular scales .
they show that the effect strongly depends on the choice of @xmath3 and that it decreases if the higher multipoles are included in the analysis .
a re - analysis of the latter has been presented by the wmap team @xcite , where the connection between the asymmetry and the cutoff scale is further investigated .
however , the polarization sector remains poorly explored in this context .
@xcite investigated the properties of the cmb polarization field on the two hemispheres defined by @xmath0 @xcite , exploiting an implementation of the quadratic maximum likelihood ( qml ) method @xcite .
no significant anomalies in the polarization and temperature - polarization cross - correlation were found in wmap 5-year data @xcite .
dipolar modulations in temperature and polarization have been studied in @xcite , and more recently in @xcite .    in the present work we test the hemispherical power asymmetry at large scale on wmap 7-year temperature and polarization maps without any theoretical assumptions . by sampling the whole sky in 24 equally - spaced symmetry axis , we test the power asymmetry on as many pairs of hemispheres . for each of those ,
we compute the same figures of merit as we did in our previous work @xcite .
moreover , we analyze the dependence of our results from the parameter @xmath4 along the lines suggested in @xcite , showing that our conclusions are only mildly affected by any _ a posteriori _ choice .    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2
we describe the methodology , the estimators and the dataset of our analysis . in section 3 we present our results assessing their significance by monte carlo simulations . in section 4
we discuss the implications of power asymmetries in polarization for non - isotropic models . in section 5
we draw our main conclusions .
in this section we review the algebra of the qml estimator , we define the 24 pairs of hemispheres under investigation and describe our dataset , simulations and estimators .      in order to evaluate the angular power spectra
, we use the qml estimator .
the qml formalism was introduced in @xcite and extended to polarization in @xcite . in this section
we describe the essence of the method .
further details can be found in @xcite where the _ bolpol _ code , our implementation of the qml estimator , has been applied to wmap 5-year low - resolution data .
given a map in temperature and polarization @xmath5 , the qml provides estimates @xmath6 - with @xmath7 being one of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 - of the angular power spectrum as :    @xmath14 \ , , \ ] ]    where the fisher matrix @xmath15 is defined as    @xmath16 \,,\ ] ]    and the @xmath17 matrix is given by    @xmath18    with @xmath19 being the global ( signal plus noise ) covariance matrix and @xmath20 the fiducial power spectrum .
although an initial assumption for a fiducial power spectrum @xmath21 is needed , the qml method provides unbiased estimates of the power spectrum contained in the map regardless of the initial guess , @xmath22 where the average is taken over the ensemble of realizations and @xmath23 denotes the underlying model .
the covariance matrix associated to the estimates is the inverse fisher matrix , @xmath24 and it does depend on the assumption for the fiducial power spectrum @xmath21 : the closer the guess to the true power spectrum is , the closer are the error bars to minimum variance . according to the cramer - rao inequality , eq .
( [ minimum ] ) tells us that the qml has the smallest error bars .
we thus call the qml an ` optimal ' estimator .      in order to uniformly sample the sky ,
we have chosen 24 directions , as shown in fig .
[ dirmap ] , defined by the centers of a healpix @xcite @xmath25 grid .
direction @xmath26 will identify the axis defined by the @xmath27-th point of the grid .    for each of those , we have built a pair ( north / south ) of hemispherical masks at resolution @xmath28 .
the hemispherical masks have been combined with the wmap low - resolution galactic masks for temperature ( kq85 ) and polarization ( p06 ) .     grid .
the color scale runs from blue ( @xmath29 ) to red ( @xmath30 ) .
the black line defines the area of interest ( see subsection [ subsec : angular ] ) . ]
we use the temperature ilc map smoothed at @xmath31 degrees and reconstructed at healpix resolution @xmath28 , to which we add a random noise realization with variance of @xmath32 , as suggested in @xcite .
consistently , the noise covariance matrix for @xmath8 is taken to be diagonal with variance equal to @xmath32 .
for the polarization sector , we have adopted the @xmath33 foreground cleaned low - resolution dataset publicly available at the lambda website .
frequency maps ( @xmath34 ) and covariance matrices ( @xmath35 ) have been co - added as follows , @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .
maps and covariances for the two sky regions ( namely north and south ) have been consistently tailored to the combined masks .    to assess the significance of the power asymmetries found in the data , our results have been tested against monte carlo simulations .
a set of 10000 cmb+noise sky realizations has been generated : the signal was generated from the wmap 7-year best - fit model @xcite , the noise through a cholesky decomposition of the global ( @xmath40 ) noise covariance matrix .
we have then computed the angular power spectra for each of the 10000 simulations using _ bolpol _ and built two figures of merit as explained in the next subsection .
we define the following quantities @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the estimated angular power spectra obtained with _
bolpol _ observing only the northern ( ` @xmath44 ' ) and the southern ( ` @xmath45 ' ) hemisphere respectively , outside the galactic plane .
as above , @xmath7 runs over the spectral types .
two estimators can be built as follows : the ratio @xmath46 , as performed in @xcite ,     for @xmath8 computed for @xmath47 ( dotted green ) , 24 ( dashed red ) , 32 ( dot - dashed blue ) , for direction @xmath48 , the one closer to the axis found by @xcite .
the vertical lines show the value we extract from the wmap data whereas the smoothed probability distribution are drawn from monte carlo simulations .

to wmap data , both estimators may be considered for @xmath8 , while only the @xmath49 estimator has been applied to the other spectra ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , because of unfavorable signal - to - noise ratio of the wmap data in polarization .

the corresponding level of asymmetry is explicitly shown in table [ tablevaluesdir14 ] for the corresponding multipole intervals .
the monte carlo distribution does not depend on the specific direction considered , as the estimators are computed by maximizing the asymmetry over the 24 directions under investigation ( see subsection 3.2 for more details ) .

the five panels are for @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively.,title="fig : " ]    however , our extension of the same analysis to other direction in the sky suggests that also directions @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 have a comparable , or even higher , level of power asymmetry .
this is shown in fig .
[ plotrddirtt ] , where we plot the percentage level of hemispherical asymmetry as defined by our sample of 24 directions for the same three maximum angular scales , @xmath47 , 24 , 36 .
those correspond to the region highlighted by the black circle in fig .
[ dirmap ] .
we will further investigate such region in the next subsection .
no significant hemispherical asymmetry is manifest in the cross- and polarization spectra ( see fig . [ plotddirpol ] ) , where the low signal - to - noise ratio reflects onto @xmath60-dependent fluctuations of @xmath49 .
we have also checked that @xmath12 and @xmath13 cross - spectra are well consistent with no asymmetry .     versus @xmath3 .

we restrict to directions @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath48 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and let @xmath3 vary from 2 to 32 .
results are reported in figs .
[ rdellmax1],[rdellmax2 ] .
we observe that the cumulative power up to multipoles @xmath61 does not show significant asymmetry , for none of the 5 hemispherical pairs considered .
the only exceptions are @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively .
we also notice that direction @xmath57 ( red curve ) , defined by galactic coordinates ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) , shows a constant , very high level of asymmetry through almost all the multipoles explored here , reaching the maximum for @xmath66 as high as @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) for @xmath53 ( @xmath49 ) .      throughout the present work ,
uncertainties are assessed by monte carlo simulations . in our assessments and prevents us from properly exploring effects at more than @xmath69 . ] for each simulated cmb sky , the maximum asymmetry for a given angular scale does not necessarily lie along the direction which maximizes the asymmetry in the data . therefore , in order to properly sample the probability distribution from simulated skies , one has to maximize the asymmetry with respect to all the possible orientations , 24 in our analysis ( see @xcite for a similar analysis in the context of mirror symmetry ) .
this is referred to as the ` look elsewhere ' effect , and it has been properly taken into account in this work .
( solid red curve ) with what one would obtain if not accounting for the ` elsewhere effect ' ( dashed blue curve ) .
top panel is for @xmath53 , bottom panel for @xmath49.,title="fig : " ]   ( solid red curve ) with what one would obtain if not accounting for the ` elsewhere effect ' ( dashed blue curve ) .
top panel is for @xmath53 , bottom panel for @xmath49.,title="fig : " ]    to stress the importance of this procedure , we show the impact on the estimated asymmetry of neglecting such effect .
we fix one direction , @xmath70 , and compute @xmath53 and @xmath49 for 10000 cmb+noise simulated skies on the corresponding observed sky , without maximizing the estimators with respect to the other 23 directions .
we compare then our distributions to wmap asymmetry as estimated on the same sky fraction .
the result of such a test is shown in fig .
[ mctest ] .
the dashed blue curves show the asymmetry ( as a function of @xmath3 ) for the procedure just described , whereas the solid red curves refer to the correct analysis ( see also figs .
[ rdellmax1 ] , [ rdellmax2 ] ) . as expected , neglecting the ` look elsewhere effect ' would lead to overestimate the significance of the asymmetry .      as pointed out by the wmap team @xcite
, care must be taken in assessing the significance of any claimed anomaly in the data , such as the hemispherical power asymmetry .
we propose here the analogous of the analysis suggested in @xcite for the dipole power asymmetry .
the idea is to associate a probability to our estimators as obtained from the wmap dataset without any _ a posteriori _ choice of the @xmath3 parameter .
we want to compare the maximum probability ( @xmath71 ) of asymmetry in the data to a distribution of probabilities drawn from mc simulations where @xmath3 is chosen to maximize the asymmetry for each simulation independently .
we let @xmath3 vary from 2 to 32 .
we focus on the @xmath49 estimator for the temperature field .
according to what shown in the previous subsection , we restrict our investigation to direction @xmath70 , for which the maximum value of @xmath49 is reached for @xmath66 and corresponds to a significance @xmath72 .
such a value has to be compared to the distribution of significance for the maximum asymmetry obtained from mc simulations ( @xmath73 ) where @xmath3 is let free to move . in other words , for each extraction , @xmath3 is chosen such that it maximizes the asymmetry of @xmath49 .    .
we plot the ( normalized ) number of simulations ( @xmath74-axis ) out of 10000 showing a given level of percentage asymmetry ( @xmath75-axis ) as computed by letting @xmath3 vary for each simulation independently .
three cases are show : @xmath66 ( red ) , @xmath76 ( green ) and @xmath77 ( blue ) .
the black vertical line marks the wmap value @xmath72 . ]
our results are reported in fig .
[ signif ] , where the distribution of 10000 values of @xmath73 is shown for three cases : @xmath3 is kept fixed to a single ( arbitrary ) value ( dashed red line ) , @xmath78 ( dotted green line ) and @xmath79 ( solid blue line ) .
the wmap value is also reported as ( dashed ) black vertical line . as expected , we find that the probability for @xmath80 to be anomalous decreases as we widen the range allowed for @xmath3 . however , even for @xmath77 , the probability that a mc simulation has a value of @xmath73 that is larger than @xmath80 is still as low as @xmath81 .
we wish now to briefly discuss the implications of power asymmetries in polarization at large angular scales for non - isotropic cosmological models . as a non - isotropic model
, we consider the simple dipole modulation introduced in @xcite to explain the hemispherical asymmetry .    to assess the relative importance of polarization ,
we extend the model originally introduced for temperature to a full polarized ( @xmath40 ) map by    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the ( @xmath40 ) isotropic contribution for the pixel @xmath27 pointing towards direction @xmath84 , @xmath85 is the instrumental noise contribution , @xmath86 is the dipolar direction in the sky and @xmath87 is the amplitude of the dipolar effect .
whereas the wmap instrumental noise prevents the information enclosed in the power asymmetries in polarization to be a useful addition to the temperature asymmetry generated by a dipolar modulation of eq .
( [ eq : dipole ] ) , our estimator @xmath49 can be useful at planck sensitivity . in order to forecast the planck capabilities
, we follow paci et al .
( see also @xcite ) and assume uncorrelated uniform instrumental noise , whose amplitude is consistent with the planck 143ghz channel sensitivity , @xmath88k and @xmath89k for temperature and polarization respectively @xcite .
we choose one direction in the sky , i.e. @xmath90 , and compute the difference power on the two hemispheres defined by the same direction for 10000 simulated skies .
as amplitude we choose @xmath91 , according to a previous analysis relying on a different estimator , but based on wmap data at the same resolution and gaussian smoothing scale as in the current work @xcite .
[ dipole ] shows the probability distribution of @xmath92 , defined by @xmath93 for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 spectrum computed up to @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively .
our results demonstrate that polarization power spectra asymmetries will help in characterizing better a dipolar modulation , even at the @xmath28 resolution with a temperature gaussian smoothing of 9.1285 degrees : of course , due to the lower s / n with which cmb polarization is observed , polarization can not compete with the capability to detect the dipole asymmetry by using temperature power asymmetry .
this relative importance of polarization with respect to temperature agrees with an analogous planck forecast @xcite , albeit for the different non - isotropic model based on a quadrupolar modulation .
it is also interesting to compare the current observational status with the predictions of the simple toy model in eq .
( [ eq : dipole ] ) .
the wmap 7-year @xmath92 estimators in temperature and @xmath9 polarization displayed in fig .
[ dipole ] have opposite sign , differently from the predictions of the simple toy model in eq .
( [ eq : dipole ] ) in which the asymmetries have the same sign ( as also predicted by the quadrupolar modulation in @xcite ) .
we also note that hemispherical power asymmetry in temperature @xmath92 predicted by eq .
( [ eq : dipole ] ) with @xmath91 - which corresponds to the results in @xcite - is smaller than the one found on wmap 7-year data by our qml analysis .     for @xmath8 ( blue dotted line ) and @xmath9 ( red dashed line ) , for @xmath3=32 and @xmath3=12 respectively .
vertical lines shows the corresponding values as observed in the wmap data . ]
we have performed for the first time a scan of the cmb sky in temperature and polarization searching for hemispherical asymmetries at low multipoles .
we have sampled the whole sky in 24 directions and computed the six angular power spectra of the cmb through our implementation of the qml estimator .
as adopted in previous analyses , we have estimated the hemispherical asymmetry along each axis as the ratio and the difference of the angular power up to a given scale @xmath3 , which we use as free parameter in the analysis .
we find the maximum hemispherical asymmetry of the temperature field if the symmetry axis is chosen along galactic coordinates ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) and on angular scales @xmath96 .
the significance of such an asymmetry is @xmath68 when computed through the estimator @xmath49 . in order to support our findings ,
we have tested the impact of the _ a posteriori _ choice of @xmath3 in the analysis .
we find that the anomalous asymmetry is milder once the @xmath3 parameter is released , although still as high as @xmath97 . in the polarization sector
, we find no significant hemispherical asymmetry , neither along the direction studied in our previous work , nor with respect to any other symmetry axis considered here .
we have also tested the possibility of detecting a dipolar modulation of the cmb by our methodology at planck sensitivity .
our analysis shows that simple estimators as the hemispherical power asymmetries constructed by the qml will be a useful complement to temperature for planck .

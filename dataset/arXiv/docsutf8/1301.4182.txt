electronic bilayer systems have recently drawn increasing attention due to new experimental results on electronic transport @xcite as well as due to the discovery of the novel macroscopic ordering driven by quantum effects.@xcite in a generic situation such systems consist of two spacially separated and mutually insulated semiconducting layers which can be individually gated . on the other hand ,
the interlayer separation is engineered in such a way that the coulomb interaction between majority carriers in both subsystems is still large .
this can be achieved by an appropriate choice for the barrier material .
@xcite in such a situation the formation of excitons is possible .
even a condensation of such electron - hole pairs was predicted @xcite and subsequently observed in several experiments performed on gaas quantum wells using algaas as the insulating barrier at total filling factor @xmath0 in the quantum hall regime .
@xcite    while the non - linear transport characteristics of such systems have been investigated before @xcite , their noise properties received only little attention . in
we tried to close this gap and have calculated the cumulant generating function ( cgf ) of a bilayer system attached to four different electrodes .
some very interesting effects were found , which can only be attributed to the non - trivial interactions between the layers . in order to perform the calculations one had to assume that the transport processes at different junctions occur in an incoherent fashion ( sequential tunneling ) . despite this severe restriction the currents in both layers
are correlated due to the locality of the bound electron - hole pairs . here
we would like to drop this assumption and consider a fully coherent system .
the paper is organized as follows . in the next section
we introduce the system and give the details of its mathematical implementation .
we briefly review the main results of and adapt them to a recent experimental setup presented in . in section [ s3 ]
we present a toy model consisting of two short hubbard chains , which are coupled with each other , so that a formation of an interchain electron - hole pair or exciton is adequately described . in the next step
we calculate the full counting statistics , compare the predictions of both models , analyze their similarities and discrepancies .
we briefly summarize the results in section [ s4 ] .
the basic system we study is depicted in fig .
[ fig1 ] : a semiconducting bilayer is contacted by four metallic electrodes via tunnel contacts .
the hamiltonian of the system reads @xcite @xmath1 where the term @xmath2 describes the four metallic electrodes which are described as fermionic continua written in terms of electron field operators @xmath3 at chemical potentials @xmath4 .
@xmath5 refers to the contacts on the left / right side of the respective layer and @xmath6 labels the top and bottom layer , respectively .
we assume the leads to be in the wide flat band limit so that their density of states ( dos ) @xmath7 is constant and denote the fermi distribution functions in the respective electrode by @xmath8 .
for the phenomena we would like to consider the spin degree of freedom is irrelevant , therefore we work with a spinless system .
@xmath9 is the tunneling hamiltonian describing hopping between each layer of the bilayer and the corresponding metallic electrodes @xmath10 using tunneling amplitudes @xmath11 .
finally , @xmath12 describes the bilayer using a simple one - dimensional model as in ( we shall discuss generalizations to higher dimensions later ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the longitudinal distance between the right and left side of the semiconductor , @xmath15 is the two - layer spinor and @xmath16 describe the electron / hole single particle hamiltonian of the top and bottom layer .
we describe the interlayer coulomb interaction by an exciton order parameter @xmath17 , which in general is a space - dependent quantity .
@xcite its absolute value @xmath18 in equilibrium represents the excitonic gap and directly gives the exciton coherence length @xmath19 .
it can be determined self - consistently from the interlayer interaction as in bcs theory.@xcite + in order to calculate the cumulant generating function ( cgf ) of charge transfer we use a green s function ( gf ) method developed for quantum impurities in . for every electrode present in the system we have to introduce a fictitious measuring field @xmath20 which counts an electron when it crosses the electrode - semiconductor junction in question . in this manner fluctuations ,
either caused by the discreteness of charge or thermally induced , can be taken care of .
the measuring fields are both contour and time - dependent : they are nonzero only during the measurement time @xmath21 and change sign on the @xmath22 and @xmath23 branch of the keldysh contour .
this procedure allows for the calculation of the cgf for arbitrary parameters in eq .
( [ htotal ] ) as discussed in and has already been applied to numerous quantum impurity problems ( see e.g. ) .
the cgf can be calculated as a generalized keldysh partition function @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the keldysh contour ordering operator and @xmath26 can be derived from the tunnel hamiltonian in eq .
( [ htunnel ] ) using the substitution @xmath27 . in order to calculate the cgf
we then rewrite the expression using the adiabatic potential method in the limit of long measurement times @xmath21 as @xmath28 .
the adiabatic potential @xmath29 may in turn be rewritten in terms of the bare and exact - in - tunneling gfs of the system described by eq .
( [ htotal ] ) .
the hamiltonian in eq .
( [ hec ] ) is very similar to the bcs hamiltonian .
indeed , @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be interpreted as pseudospin indices to map this hamiltonian with the additional exchange of @xmath31 holes to electrons onto bcs theory.@xcite also one has to take into account that electrons and holes each have their own chemical potential @xmath32.@xcite consequently we can also rephrase our problem as the calculation of the spin - dependent cgf for a normal - superconductor - normal ( nsn ) junction with different chemical potentials for the spin species .
we want to stress that despite the modelling of the condensate as a perfect homogeneous system in describing the tunneling we assume for the dephasing time @xmath33 : @xmath34 ( incoherent tunneling approximation ) .
the cgfs for different normal - superconductor hybrid structures have been considered before .
@xcite here the task is to work out the spin - dependent case , to take care of the presence of electrons instead of holes in the lower layer and to address the case of a bilayer contacted from two sides .
however , the @xmath17-coupling in eq .
is formally a tunneling term .
since the layers are supposed to be isolated from each other we have to suppress particle current flowing between the layers .
this is very conveniently done by adjusting the chemical potentials in the layers self - consistently .
a similar procedure was implemented for a normal - superconductor - normal junction in ref .  .
under such circumstances it is then unimportant whether we count charges on the left side or the right side of the respective bilayer .
this means that we can then calculate the cgf only for the left side and obtain the one for the right side by exchanging @xmath35 .
we would like to point out that this self - consistency condition is very different from the conventional one inspired by the bcs theory as it defines the _ relative _ position of the exciton chemical potential with respect to the ones in the external electrodes .    using the microscopic hamiltonian approach as outlined in ref .
we have obtained the complete expression for the temperature and energy dependent cgf , valid for arbitrary values of the model parameters .
@xcite the expression , which has been used for our numerical calculations , is quite lengthy and we do not report it here .
nevertheless , all relevant ingredients of the cgf already appear in the limits of small bias ( @xmath36 ) and large bias ( @xmath37 ) , where the expression of the cgf greatly simplifies . indeed in these regimes the non - interacting self - energy due to
the ec is either real and purely off - diagonal or imaginary and purely diagonal , like in a superconductor @xcite , while the one due to the normal lead is always diagonal . in these regimes
the cgf acquires the following expression    @xmath38\right\ } \theta\left(\frac{|\omega_\sigma| - \delta}{\delta}\right ) \nonumber\\ & & + \ln \left\{1 + t_a(\omega ) \left[(e^{i \lambda_{lt } } e^{-i \lambda_{lb } } -1 ) n_{lt } ( 1-n_{lb } ) \right .
\nonumber\\ & & \left .
+ ( e^{i \lambda_{lb } } e^{-i \lambda_{lt } } -1 ) n_{lb } ( 1-n_{lt } ) \right]\right\}\theta\left(\frac{\delta - \max(|\omega_t| , \ ;
|\omega_b|)}{\delta}\right)\right ] , \label{cgf}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    where @xmath39 and the transmission coefficients are given by @xmath40 the energy - dependent dos of the ec affects the hybridisations @xmath41 where @xmath42 , with the dos of the ec given by @xmath43 .
@xmath44 refers to a fermi distribution function at chemical potentials @xmath45 characterising the layer of the semiconductor .
we use units such that @xmath46 and @xmath47 .
the first line of the cgf describes the supra - gap contribution , which is only due to single electron transport in the simplified form given here and characterised by the normal transmission coefficient @xmath48 .
the second line describes the sub - gap contribution due to excitonic andreev reflection @xcite in which an electron and a hole ( in different layers ) enter or leave the ec .
@xmath45 now have to be chosen such that @xcite @xmath49 for the sake of simplicity we consider the symmetric case @xmath50 and @xmath51
. then the requirement eq .
( [ self ] ) is always fulfilled for @xmath52 if @xmath53 and @xmath54 .
this condition also implies that no current is flowing between the upper and lower layer.@xcite    it is interesting to use the above formula to test fluctuation theorems .
we have done so for the full result but for the sake of simplicity we illustrate the test for eq .
( [ cgf ] ) .
one of the most celebrated examples is the cohen - gallavotti relation , which can be directly related to a symmetry of the cgf.@xcite for a single counting field @xmath55 the cgf is expected to obey in the limit of long measurement time @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the inverse temperature .
however , in our case we encounter several complications compared to this simple case .
first , the presence of an interlayer coulomb interaction gives rise to the subgap contribution in eq .
( [ cgf ] ) which couples the top and bottom layer and therefore requires to extend the simple relation in eq .
( [ simplecohen ] ) to both @xmath30 and @xmath31 counting fields .
additionally different voltages can be applied on the top and bottom layer .
finally , we had to mind self - consistency which we satisfy by setting @xmath58 . still , a relation similar to eq .
( [ simplecohen ] ) holds , namely @xcite @xmath59 even though this is a straightforward generalisation of the cohen - gallavotti relation in eq .
( [ simplecohen ] ) the above relation provides an example how correlations affect the fluctuations in quantum systems . in this way we have supplied an example of a system where a generalized cohen - gallavotti fluctuation theorem holds .    from the cgf in ( [ cgf ] ) we can read off several interesting transport features . at @xmath60 and @xmath61
the excitonic andreev reflections dominate the charge transport .
then we immediately obtain @xmath62 consequently , we correctly predict that the excitonic andreev reflections induce counterpropagating currents in the layers.@xcite depending on the bias choice we observe different transport features . for equal bias in the two layers
@xmath63 the magnitude of the current becomes zero ( exciton blockade ) .
if only one layer is biased an opposite current in the other layer is induced ( drag ) .
if we further increase the bias difference between the layers the counterflowing currents increase.@xcite this resembles the transport features observable under phase bias instead of voltage bias.@xcite    so far only experiments in a typical drag configuration have been made .
the inset of fig .
[ fig2 ] ( a ) shows a sketch of the experiment described in , where two corbino disks are realized in a gaas / algaas double quantum well structure . the experiment is performed in the @xmath64 quantum hall state of the system and we expect exciton formation between the two corbino disks that serve as the top and bottom layer indicated in fig . [ fig1 ] . in the top layer a current
can be excited and additionally the induced drag current in the bottom layer is recorded .
+ we calculate the current from eq .
( [ cgf ] ) and use @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67ev .
we observe good qualitative agreement in fig .
[ fig2 ] ( a ) .
+ we only observe a slight deviation in the bottom current for voltages above the exciton gap .
we ascribe this discrepancy to a small interlayer tunnel coupling that might still be present in the system and is also suggested from the analysis of the experimental data .    the next logical step is to compute the higher cumulants of the fcs .
a number of details was already given in ref .  .
the current cross correlation of the top and bottom current for the setup shown in fig .
[ fig2 ] ( a ) is plotted in fig .
[ fig2 ] ( b ) using the same parameters . as we see from fig .
[ fig2 ] ( b ) one does not observe a positive cross correlation .
this is very different from the setup in which a superconductor is contacted to two normal drains , in which one observes a positive cross correlation of the two currents in the normal leads via crossed andreev reflection .
@xcite this discrepancy is due to the fact that we observe the correlation of electrons and holes and not correlations of electron pairs as in the case of superconductors . in this case
the positive cross - correlation mediated by crossed andreev reflection turns into an anti - correlation .
we expect that this negative correlations should be observable in the experiments similar to the one presented in ref .     up to now
we have considered a 1d system . due to pointlike contacts to bias electrodes
all excitations travel as @xmath68-waves even in higher - dimensional systems , in particular in genuine 2d layers . on the other hand ,
the ground state changes due to @xmath17 coupling between the layers are qualitatively the same in any dimension since the diagonalization procedure is dimension - independent . in connection with the assumption of incoherent tunnelling
we conclude that the physical picture obtained above also holds for 2d layered systems .
we expect fundamental changes to occur in the case of extended contacts when a number of different transport channels are possible
. however , as long as these channels are non - interacting the corresponding fcs would be a simple sum of expressions for individual channels .
a very similar procedure was considered in in connection with superconducting contacts .
now we would like to abandon restrictions we made in the previous section .
an appropriate model would be two non - interacting fermionic continua particle - hole coupled and perfectly clean so that @xmath69 can be safely assumed .
such structure is , however , quite difficult to handle .
therefore we model the layers by tight - binding chains of finite lengths .
it turns out that in order to account for most of the transport physics we only need to keep two sites in each chain .
the effective model can then schematically represented as shown in fig .
.     has been replaced by two pairs of tight binding chains which have an excitonic coupling described by @xmath70.,width=226 ]     + the pairs 1,2 and 3,4 represent different layers of the device .
the chemical potentials are now replaced by the bare energies of the sites @xmath71 .
then the bilayer part of the hamiltonian is given by @xmath72 \
, , \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the tunneling amplitude between the sites within the respective chain and @xmath74 is the exciton coupling .
@xmath73 corresponds to the fermi velocity of a continuum realization whereas @xmath74 in the equivalent of the exciton coupling @xmath17 ( it is measured in different units though ) .
coupling to the electrodes is modeled in a way similar to that of eq .
, @xmath75 for simplicity we have chosen all tunneling amplitudes to the electrodes to be of the same magnitude and the dos in each electrode to be @xmath7 . in order to compute the fcs one performs the same transformation as shown in the previous sections in order to generate @xmath76 . after that the cumulant generating function can be evaluated using functional integration .
we integrate the electrode degrees of freedom first , thereby obtaining the new effective green s functions for the individual sites of the bilayer , @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the respective counting fields .
then the cgf is written as @xmath81 \
, e^{-s } \
, , \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath82 @xmath83 are superfields defined by @xmath84 here the index @xmath85 denotes the keldysh component of the respective field . after the calculation of the functional integral we finally obtain @xmath86 \ , .\end{aligned}\ ] ] @xmath87 are yet to be appropriately chosen . to fix them
we perform the same procedure as in section [ s2 ] .
we compute the currents on both junctions of the upper layer and equalize them . on the other hand , from symmetry arguments it turns out that the choice @xmath88 is particularly convenient .
one interesting parameter constellation is the situation of no bias in one of the layers ( the upper one for definiteness ) and finite voltage applied symmetrically around @xmath89 in the bottom subsystem .
one can produce analytical formulas for the direct current in the bottom layer ( @xmath90 ) as well as for the induced current in the top layer ( @xmath91 ) , valid at all temperatures , @xmath92 \ , , \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath93 are the fermi distribution functions in the respective electrodes .
the effective transmission coefficients @xmath94 have an interesting structure .
they are particularly simple under the assumption @xmath95 , @xmath96}{(\gamma^2 + \omega^2 ) [ \gamma^4 + 2\gamma^2 ( \gamma^2 - \omega^2 ) + ( \gamma^2 + \omega^2)^2 ] }   \nonumber \\
d_{\rm ind}(\omega ) & = &    \frac { \gamma^2 \gamma^2 [ \gamma^2 - ( \gamma^2 + \omega^2)]}{(\gamma^2 + \omega^2 ) [ \gamma^4 + 2 \gamma^2 ( \gamma^2 - \omega^2 ) + ( \gamma^2 + \omega^2)^2 ] } \ , .\end{aligned}\ ] ] first of all we observe that @xmath97 is a positively definite quantity and has no zeros , as one would expect from a conventional transmission coefficient .
being a ` good ' transmission coefficient , its denominator does not have any zeros on the real axis either .
the induced current is finite in almost all parameter regimes .
however , for @xmath98 @xmath99 changes sign at @xmath100 . as a result two different generic behaviour types can be observed . for weak
@xmath101 @xmath102 flows in the direction opposite to @xmath103 .
this regime is largely compatible with the exciton blockade case and we shall call it ` exciton ' regime . here
the hybridization of the layer states with their ` own ' electrodes is dominant . in the opposite case of large @xmath104 the currents flow in the same direction and
one is confronted with the standard drag situation .
these two regimes can also be observed also for @xmath105 , see fig . [
fig5](a ) .
strong @xmath106 couplings tend to destroy the excitonic state favoring a rearrangement of individual energy levels in such a way that from the point of view of incoming electrons the constriction is a larger quantum dot rather than two individual layers .
nonetheless , the particle counterflow might be significant .
this is the feature our toy model shares with the system considered in the previous section [ s2 ] .        in the next step
we compute the cross correlation of currents in the layers .
the calculations are as straightforward as in the case of the current .
the results for the cross cumulant of the induced and direct currents for representative parameter sets are shown in fig .
[ fig5 ] ( b ) .
it turns out that the correlations are remarkably strong and as far as their amplitude is concerned their voltage behavior quantitatively follows the results of the incoherent approximation .
a fundamental difference is however , the sign of the correlations which never changes sign and is always positive , unlike the situation discussed in section [ s2 ] .
as we have seen above , a drag counterflow due to the exciton coupling is present in both models .
this is a very remarkable result in view of the fact , that in the first model transport is assumed to be completely incoherent ( @xmath33 is finite and small ) . on the other hand , while the cross cumulant of the induced and direct currents turns out to be positive in the second model , it is negative in the incoherent approximation . from the physical point of view
the fundamental difference between the models is the fully developed gap in the excitation spectrum of the incoherent model .
it can not be generated in the toy model though .
therefore we conclude that for our setups : ( i ) for the observation of the drag counterflow the gap is not necessary while it is necessary for perfect coulomb drag ; ( ii ) in the presence of the exciton coupling the counterflow can be achieved even in disordered systems ; ( iii ) current anticorrelations exist only in the gapped systems .
we expect these predictions to be observable in the upcoming experiments .

ABSTRACT
Interactions between agents in an open system such as the
Internet require a significant degree of flexibility. A crucial
aspect of the development of such methods is the notion of
commitments, which provides a mechanism for 
coordinating interactive behaviors among agents. In this paper, we
investigate an approach to model commitments with tight
integration with protocol actions. This means that there
is no need to have an explicit mapping from protocols 
actions to operations on commitments and an external 
mechanism to process and enforce commitments. We show how
agents can reason about commitments and protocol actions
to achieve the end results of protocols using a reasoning 
system based on temporal linear logic, which incorporates both
temporal and resource-sensitive reasoning. We also discuss
the application of this framework to scenarios such as online
commerce.

ABSTRACT
This paper proposes dynamic semantics for agent 
communication languages (ACLs) as a method for tackling some
of the fundamental problems associated with agent 
communication in open multiagent systems. Based on the idea
of providing alternative semantic variants for speech acts
and transition rules between them that are contingent on
previous agent behaviour, our framework provides an 
improved notion of grounding semantics in ongoing interaction,
a simple mechanism for distinguishing between compliant
and expected behaviour, and a way to specify sanction and
reward mechanisms as part of the ACL itself. We extend a
common framework for commitment-based ACL semantics
to obtain these properties, discuss desiderata for the design
of concrete dynamic semantics together with examples, and
analyse their properties.

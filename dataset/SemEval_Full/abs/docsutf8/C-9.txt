ABSTRACT
As the idea of virtualisation of compute power, storage and
bandwidth becomes more and more important, grid 
computing evolves and is applied to a rising number of applications.
The environment for decentralized adaptive services (EDAS)
provides a grid-like infrastructure for user-accessed, 
longterm services (e.g. webserver, source-code repository etc.).
It aims at supporting the autonomous execution and 
evolution of services in terms of scalability and resource-aware
distribution. EDAS offers flexible service models based on
distributed mobile objects ranging from a traditional 
clientserver scenario to a fully peer-to-peer based approach. 
Automatic, dynamic resource management allows optimized use
of available resources while minimizing the administrative
complexity.

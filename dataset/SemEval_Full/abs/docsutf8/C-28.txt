ABSTRACT
In this paper, we propose an adaptive task allocation 
framework to perform BLAST searches in a grid environment
against sequence database segments. The framework, called
PackageBLAST, provides an infrastructure to choose or 
incorporate task allocation strategies. Furthermore, we 
propose a mechanism to compute grid nodes execution weight,
adapting the chosen allocation policy to the current 
computational power of the nodes. Our results present very good
speedups and also show that no single allocation strategy is
able to achieve the lowest execution times for all scenarios.

Distance Measures for MPEG-7-based Retrieval
ABSTRACT
In visual information retrieval the careful choice of suitable 
proximity measures is a crucial success factor. The evaluation 
presented in this paper aims at showing that the distance measures 
suggested by the MPEG-7 group for the visual descriptors can be 
beaten by general-purpose measures. Eight visual MPEG-7 
descriptors were selected and 38 distance measures implemented. 
Three media collections were created and assessed, performance 
indicators developed and more than 22500 tests performed. 
Additionally, a quantisation model was developed to be able to 
use predicate-based distance measures on continuous data as well. 
The evaluation shows that the distance measures recommended in 
the MPEG-7-standard are among the best but that other measures 
perform even better.

ABSTRACT
We propose a methodology for building a practical robust
query classification system that can identify thousands of
query classes with reasonable accuracy, while dealing in 
realtime with the query volume of a commercial web search 
engine. We use a blind feedback technique: given a query,
we determine its topic by classifying the web search results
retrieved by the query. Motivated by the needs of search 
advertising, we primarily focus on rare queries, which are the
hardest from the point of view of machine learning, yet in 
aggregation account for a considerable fraction of search engine
traffic. Empirical evaluation confirms that our methodology
yields a considerably higher classification accuracy than 
previously reported. We believe that the proposed methodology
will lead to better matching of online ads to rare queries and
overall to a better user experience.

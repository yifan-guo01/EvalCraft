ABSTRACT
Web search engines present lists of captions, comprising 
title, snippet, and URL, to help users decide which search
results to visit. Understanding the influence of features of
these captions on Web search behavior may help validate
algorithms and guidelines for their improved generation. In
this paper we develop a methodology to use clickthrough
logs from a commercial search engine to study user behavior
when interacting with search result captions. The findings
of our study suggest that relatively simple caption features
such as the presence of all terms query terms, the 
readability of the snippet, and the length of the URL shown in the
caption, can significantly influence users" Web search 
behavior.

ABSTRACT
The co-allocation architecture was developed in order to enable
parallel downloading of datasets from multiple servers. Several
co-allocation strategies have been coupled and used to exploit rate
differences among various client-server links and to address
dynamic rate fluctuations by dividing files into multiple blocks of
equal sizes. However, a major obstacle, the idle time of faster
servers having to wait for the slowest server to deliver the final
block, makes it important to reduce differences in finishing time
among replica servers. In this paper, we propose a dynamic 
coallocation scheme, namely Recursive-Adjustment Co-Allocation
scheme, to improve the performance of data transfer in Data Grids.
Our approach reduces the idle time spent waiting for the slowest
server and decreases data transfer completion time. We also
provide an effective scheme for reducing the cost of reassembling
data blocks.

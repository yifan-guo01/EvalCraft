ABSTRACT
We derive optimal bidding strategies for a global bidding
agent that participates in multiple, simultaneous second-price
auctions with perfect substitutes. We first consider a model
where all other bidders are local and participate in a single
auction. For this case, we prove that, assuming free 
disposal, the global bidder should always place non-zero bids in
all available auctions, irrespective of the local bidders" 
valuation distribution. Furthermore, for non-decreasing valuation
distributions, we prove that the problem of finding the 
optimal bids reduces to two dimensions. These results hold both
in the case where the number of local bidders is known and
when this number is determined by a Poisson distribution.
This analysis extends to online markets where, typically, 
auctions occur both concurrently and sequentially. In addition,
by combining analytical and simulation results, we 
demonstrate that similar results hold in the case of several global
bidders, provided that the market consists of both global and
local bidders. Finally, we address the efficiency of the overall
market, and show that information about the number of 
local bidders is an important determinant for the way in which
a global bidder affects efficiency.

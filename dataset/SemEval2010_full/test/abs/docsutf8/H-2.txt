ABSTRACT
The inherent ambiguity of short keyword queries demands for 
enhanced methods for Web retrieval. In this paper we propose to
improve such Web queries by expanding them with terms collected
from each user"s Personal Information Repository, thus implicitly
personalizing the search output. We introduce five broad 
techniques for generating the additional query keywords by analyzing
user data at increasing granularity levels, ranging from term and
compound level analysis up to global co-occurrence statistics, as
well as to using external thesauri. Our extensive empirical 
analysis under four different scenarios shows some of these approaches
to perform very well, especially on ambiguous queries, producing
a very strong increase in the quality of the output rankings. 
Subsequently, we move this personalized search framework one step
further and propose to make the expansion process adaptive to 
various features of each query. A separate set of experiments indicates
the adaptive algorithms to bring an additional statistically 
significant improvement over the best static expansion approach.

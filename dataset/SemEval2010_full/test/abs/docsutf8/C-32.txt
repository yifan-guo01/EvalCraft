ABSTRACT
Collaborative applications provide a shared work 
environment for groups of networked clients collaborating on a 
common task. They require strong consistency for shared 
persistent data and efficient access to fine-grained objects. These
properties are difficult to provide in wide-area networks 
because of high network latency.
BuddyCache is a new transactional caching approach that
improves the latency of access to shared persistent objects
for collaborative strong-consistency applications in 
high-latency network environments. The challenge is to improve
performance while providing the correctness and availability
properties of a transactional caching protocol in the presence
of node failures and slow peers.
We have implemented a BuddyCache prototype and 
evaluated its performance. Analytical results, confirmed by
measurements of the BuddyCache prototype using the 
multiuser 007 benchmark indicate that for typical Internet 
latencies, e.g. ranging from 40 to 80 milliseconds round trip time
to the storage server, peers using BuddyCache can reduce by
up to 50% the latency of access to shared objects compared
to accessing the remote servers directly.

ABSTRACT
We develop a framework for trading in compound securities:
financial instruments that pay off contingent on the 
outcomes of arbitrary statements in propositional logic. Buying
or selling securities-which can be thought of as betting on
or against a particular future outcome-allows agents both
to hedge risk and to profit (in expectation) on subjective
predictions. A compound securities market allows agents
to place bets on arbitrary boolean combinations of events,
enabling them to more closely achieve their optimal risk 
exposure, and enabling the market as a whole to more closely
achieve the social optimum. The tradeoff for allowing such
expressivity is in the complexity of the agents" and 
auctioneer"s optimization problems.
We develop and motivate the concept of a compound 
securities market, presenting the framework through a series
of formal definitions and examples. We then analyze in 
detail the auctioneer"s matching problem. We show that, with
n events, the matching problem is co-NP-complete in the
divisible case and Σp
2-complete in the indivisible case. We
show that the latter hardness result holds even under severe
language restrictions on bids. With log n events, the 
problem is polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in
the indivisible case. We briefly discuss matching algorithms
and tractable special cases.

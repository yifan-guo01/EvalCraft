ABSTRACT
Current approaches to identifying definitional sentences in the 
context of Question Answering mainly involve the use of linguistic
or syntactic patterns to identify informative nuggets. This is 
insufficient as they do not address the novelty factor that a 
definitional nugget must also possess. This paper proposes to address
the deficiency by building a Human Interest Model from external
knowledge. It is hoped that such a model will allow the 
computation of human interest in the sentence with respect to the topic. We
compare and contrast our model with current definitional question
answering models to show that interestingness plays an important
factor in definitional question answering.

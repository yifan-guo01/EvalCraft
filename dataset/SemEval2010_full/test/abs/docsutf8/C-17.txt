ABSTRACT
Real-time services have been supported by and large on 
circuitswitched networks. Recent trends favour services ported on
packet-switched networks. For audio conferencing, we need to
consider many issues - scalability, quality of the conference
application, floor control and load on the clients/servers - to name
a few. In this paper, we describe an audio service framework
designed to provide a Virtual Conferencing Environment (VCE).
The system is designed to accommodate a large number of end
users speaking at the same time and spread across the Internet.
The framework is based on Conference Servers [14], which
facilitate the audio handling, while we exploit the SIP capabilities
for signaling purposes. Client selection is based on a recent
quantifier called "Loudness Number" that helps mimic a physical
face-to-face conference. We deal with deployment issues of the
proposed solution both in terms of scalability and interactivity,
while explaining the techniques we use to reduce the traffic. We
have implemented a Conference Server (CS) application on a
campus-wide network at our Institute.

ABSTRACT
Intelligent agents that are intended to work in dynamic 
environments must be able to gracefully handle unsuccessful tasks and
plans. In addition, such agents should be able to make rational 
decisions about an appropriate course of action, which may include
aborting a task or plan, either as a result of the agent"s own 
deliberations, or potentially at the request of another agent. In this paper
we investigate the incorporation of aborts into a BDI-style 
architecture. We discuss some conditions under which aborting a task or
plan is appropriate, and how to determine the consequences of such
a decision. We augment each plan with an optional abort-method,
analogous to the failure method found in some agent programming
languages. We provide an operational semantics for the execution
cycle in the presence of aborts in the abstract agent language CAN,
which enables us to specify a BDI-based execution model without
limiting our attention to a particular agent system (such as JACK,
Jadex, Jason, or SPARK). A key technical challenge we address is
the presence of parallel execution threads and of sub-tasks, which
require the agent to ensure that the abort methods for each plan are
carried out in an appropriate sequence.

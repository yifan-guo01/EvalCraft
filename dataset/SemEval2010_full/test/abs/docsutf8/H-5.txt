ABSTRACT
This paper examines a new approach to information 
distillation over temporally ordered documents, and proposes a
novel evaluation scheme for such a framework. It combines
the strengths of and extends beyond conventional adaptive
filtering, novelty detection and non-redundant passage
ranking with respect to long-lasting information needs
(‘tasks" with multiple queries). Our approach supports
fine-grained user feedback via highlighting of arbitrary
spans of text, and leverages such information for utility
optimization in adaptive settings. For our experiments,
we defined hypothetical tasks based on news events in the
TDT4 corpus, with multiple queries per task. Answer
keys (nuggets) were generated for each query and a 
semiautomatic procedure was used for acquiring rules that allow
automatically matching nuggets against system responses.
We also propose an extension of the NDCG metric for
assessing the utility of ranked passages as a combination of
relevance and novelty. Our results show encouraging utility
enhancements using the new approach, compared to the
baseline systems without incremental learning or the novelty
detection components.

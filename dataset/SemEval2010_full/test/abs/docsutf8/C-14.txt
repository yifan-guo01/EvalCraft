ABSTRACT
In order to monitor a region for traffic traversal, sensors
can be deployed to perform collaborative target detection.
Such a sensor network achieves a certain level of detection
performance with an associated cost of deployment. This
paper addresses this problem by proposing path exposure
as a measure of the goodness of a deployment and presents
an approach for sequential deployment in steps. It illustrates
that the cost of deployment can be minimized to achieve the
desired detection performance by appropriately choosing the
number of sensors deployed in each step.

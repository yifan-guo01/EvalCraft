ABSTRACT
Human team members often develop shared expectations to
predict each other"s needs and coordinate their behaviors.
In this paper the concept Shared Belief Map is proposed
as a basis for developing realistic shared expectations among
a team of Human-Agent-Pairs (HAPs). The establishment
of shared belief maps relies on inter-agent information 
sharing, the effectiveness of which highly depends on agents" 
processing loads and the instantaneous cognitive loads of their
human partners. We investigate HMM-based cognitive load
models to facilitate team members to share the right 
information with the right party at the right time. The shared
belief map concept and the cognitive/processing load models
have been implemented in a cognitive agent 
architectureSMMall. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate
the concept, the models, and their impacts on the evolving
of shared mental models of HAP teams.

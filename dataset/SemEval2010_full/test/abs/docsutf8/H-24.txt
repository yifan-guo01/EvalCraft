ABSTRACT
One way to help all users of commercial Web search engines be
more successful in their searches is to better understand what
those users with greater search expertise are doing, and use this
knowledge to benefit everyone. In this paper we study the
interaction logs of advanced search engine users (and those not so
advanced) to better understand how these user groups search. The
results show that there are marked differences in the queries,
result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success of users we
classify as advanced (based on their use of query operators),
relative to those classified as non-advanced. Our findings have
implications for how advanced users should be supported during
their searches, and how their interactions could be used to help
searchers of all experience levels find more relevant information
and learn improved searching strategies.

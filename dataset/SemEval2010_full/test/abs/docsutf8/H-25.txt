ABSTRACT
In this paper we study term-based feedback for information 
retrieval in the language modeling approach. With term feedback
a user directly judges the relevance of individual terms without 
interaction with feedback documents, taking full control of the query
expansion process. We propose a cluster-based method for 
selecting terms to present to the user for judgment, as well as effective
algorithms for constructing refined query language models from
user term feedback. Our algorithms are shown to bring significant
improvement in retrieval accuracy over a non-feedback baseline,
and achieve comparable performance to relevance feedback. They
are helpful even when there are no relevant documents in the top.

ABSTRACT
With the growing use of dynamic web content generated from 
relational databases, traditional caching solutions for throughput and
latency improvements are ineffective. We describe a middleware
layer called Ganesh that reduces the volume of data transmitted
without semantic interpretation of queries or results. It achieves
this reduction through the use of cryptographic hashing to detect
similarities with previous results. These benefits do not require
any compromise of the strict consistency semantics provided by the
back-end database. Further, Ganesh does not require modifications
to applications, web servers, or database servers, and works with
closed-source applications and databases. Using two benchmarks
representative of dynamic web sites, measurements of our 
prototype show that it can increase end-to-end throughput by as much
as twofold for non-data intensive applications and by as much as
tenfold for data intensive ones.

ABSTRACT
Logics of knowledge and belief are often too static and 
inflexible to be used on real-world problems. In particular, they
usually offer no concept for expressing that some course of
events is more likely to happen than another. We address
this problem and extend CTLK (computation tree logic
with knowledge) with a notion of plausibility, which allows
for practical and counterfactual reasoning. The new logic
CTLKP (CTLK with plausibility) includes also a 
particular notion of belief. A plausibility update operator is added
to this logic in order to change plausibility assumptions 
dynamically. Furthermore, we examine some important 
properties of these concepts. In particular, we show that, for a
natural class of models, belief is a KD45 modality. We also
show that model checking CTLKP is PTIME-complete
and can be done in time linear with respect to the size of
models and formulae.

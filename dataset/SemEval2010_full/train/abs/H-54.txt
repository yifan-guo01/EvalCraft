ABSTRACT
This paper presents a study of incorporating domain-specific
knowledge (i.e., information about concepts and relationships
between concepts in a certain domain) in an information retrieval
(IR) system to improve its effectiveness in retrieving biomedical
literature. The effects of different types of domain-specific
knowledge in performance contribution are examined. Based on
the TREC platform, we show that appropriate use of 
domainspecific knowledge in a proposed conceptual retrieval model
yields about 23% improvement over the best reported result in
passage retrieval in the Genomics Track of TREC 2006.

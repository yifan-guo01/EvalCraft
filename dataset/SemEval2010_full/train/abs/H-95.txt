ABSTRACT
This paper proposes simple techniques for handling place 
references in search engine queries, an important aspect of geographical
information retrieval. We address not only the detection, but also
the disambiguation of place references, by matching them 
explicitly with concepts at an ontology. Moreover, when a query does not
reference any locations, we propose to use information from 
documents matching the query, exploiting geographic scopes previously
assigned to these documents. Evaluation experiments, using topics
from CLEF campaigns and logs from real search engine queries,
show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

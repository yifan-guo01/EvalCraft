ABSTRACT
E-mail users face an ever-growing challenge in managing their 
inboxes due to the growing centrality of email in the workplace for
task assignment, action requests, and other roles beyond 
information dissemination. Whereas Information Retrieval and Machine
Learning techniques are gaining initial acceptance in spam filtering
and automated folder assignment, this paper reports on a new task:
automated action-item detection, in order to flag emails that require
responses, and to highlight the specific passage(s) indicating the 
request(s) for action. Unlike standard topic-driven text classification,
action-item detection requires inferring the sender"s intent, and as
such responds less well to pure bag-of-words classification. 
However, using enriched feature sets, such as n-grams (up to n=4) with
chi-squared feature selection, and contextual cues for action-item
location improve performance by up to 10% over unigrams, using
in both cases state of the art classifiers such as SVMs with 
automated model selection via embedded cross-validation.

ABSTRACT
Weak monotonicity is a simple necessary condition for a 
social choice function to be implementable by a truthful 
mechanism. Roberts [10] showed that it is sufficient for all 
social choice functions whose domain is unrestricted. Lavi,
Mu"alem and Nisan [6] proved the sufficiency of weak 
monotonicity for functions over order-based domains and Gui,
Muller and Vohra [5] proved sufficiency for order-based 
domains with range constraints and for domains defined by
other special types of linear inequality constraints. Here we
show the more general result, conjectured by Lavi, Mu"alem
and Nisan [6], that weak monotonicity is sufficient for 
functions defined on any convex domain.

ABSTRACT
Successful negotiators prepare by determining their position
along five dimensions: Legitimacy, Options, Goals, 
Independence, and Commitment, (LOGIC). We introduce a 
negotiation model based on these dimensions and on two primitive
concepts: intimacy (degree of closeness) and balance (degree
of fairness). The intimacy is a pair of matrices that 
evaluate both an agent"s contribution to the relationship and
its opponent"s contribution each from an information view
and from a utilitarian view across the five LOGIC 
dimensions. The balance is the difference between these 
matrices. A relationship strategy maintains a target intimacy for
each relationship that an agent would like the relationship to
move towards in future. The negotiation strategy maintains
a set of Options that are in-line with the current intimacy
level, and then tactics wrap the Options in argumentation
with the aim of attaining a successful deal and 
manipulating the successive negotiation balances towards the target
intimacy.

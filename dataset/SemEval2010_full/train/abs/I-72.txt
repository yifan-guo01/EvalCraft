ABSTRACT
In online, dynamic environments, the services requested by 
consumers may not be readily served by the providers. This requires
the service consumers and providers to negotiate their service needs
and offers. Multiagent negotiation approaches typically assume
that the parties agree on service content and focus on finding a
consensus on service price. In contrast, this work develops an 
approach through which the parties can negotiate the content of a 
service. This calls for a negotiation approach in which the parties
can understand the semantics of their requests and offers and learn
each other"s preferences incrementally over time. Accordingly, we
propose an architecture in which both consumers and producers
use a shared ontology to negotiate a service. Through repetitive
interactions, the provider learns consumers" needs accurately and
can make better targeted offers. To enable fast and accurate 
learning of preferences, we develop an extension to Version Space and
compare it with existing learning techniques. We further develop
a metric for measuring semantic similarity between services and
compare the performance of our approach using different 
similarity metrics.

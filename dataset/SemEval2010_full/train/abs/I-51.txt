ABSTRACT
In this paper we will present an argumentation framework for 
learning agents (AMAL) designed for two purposes: (1) for joint 
deliberation, and (2) for learning from communication. The AMAL 
framework is completely based on learning from examples: the argument
preference relation, the argument generation policy, and the 
counterargument generation policy are case-based techniques. For join
deliberation, learning agents share their experience by forming a
committee to decide upon some joint decision. We experimentally
show that the argumentation among committees of agents improves
both the individual and joint performance. For learning from 
communication, an agent engages into arguing with other agents in 
order to contrast its individual hypotheses and receive 
counterexamples; the argumentation process improves their learning scope and
individual performance.

ABSTRACT
We consider the parallels between the preference elicitation
problem in combinatorial auctions and the problem of 
learning an unknown function from learning theory. We show
that learning algorithms can be used as a basis for 
preference elicitation algorithms. The resulting elicitation 
algorithms perform a polynomial number of queries. We also
give conditions under which the resulting algorithms have
polynomial communication. Our conversion procedure 
allows us to generate combinatorial auction protocols from
learning algorithms for polynomials, monotone DNF, and
linear-threshold functions. In particular, we obtain an 
algorithm that elicits XOR bids with polynomial 
communication.

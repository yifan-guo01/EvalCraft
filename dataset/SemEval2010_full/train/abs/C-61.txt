ABSTRACT
We present a proxy-based gaming architecture and 
authority assignment within this architecture that can lead to 
better game playing experience in Massively Multi-player 
Online games. The proposed game architecture consists of 
distributed game clients that connect to game proxies (referred
to as communication proxies) which forward game related
messages from the clients to one or more game servers. 
Unlike proxy-based architectures that have been proposed in
the literature where the proxies replicate all of the game
state, the communication proxies in the proposed 
architecture support clients that are in proximity to it in the 
physical network and maintain information about selected 
portions of the game space that are relevant only to the clients
that they support. Using this architecture, we propose an
authority assignment mechanism that divides the 
authority for deciding the outcome of different actions/events that
occur within the game between client and servers on a per
action/event basis. We show that such division of 
authority leads to a smoother game playing experience by 
implementing this mechanism in a massively multi-player online
game called RPGQuest. In addition, we argue that cheat
detection techniques can be easily implemented at the 
communication proxies if they are made aware of the game-play
mechanics.

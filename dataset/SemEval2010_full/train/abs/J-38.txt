ABSTRACT
We study coalitional games where the value of cooperation
among the agents are solely determined by the attributes
the agents possess, with no assumption as to how these 
attributes jointly determine this value. This framework 
allows us to model diverse economic interactions by picking
the right attributes. We study the computational 
complexity of two coalitional solution concepts for these 
gamesthe Shapley value and the core. We show how the positive
results obtained in this paper imply comparable results for
other games studied in the literature.

ABSTRACT
Data dissemination through wireless channels for broadcasting
information to consumers is becoming quite common. Many
dissemination schemes have been proposed but most of them push
data to wireless channels for general consumption. Push based
broadcast [1] is essentially asymmetric, i.e., the volume of data
being higher from the server to the users than from the users back
to the server. Push based scheme requires some indexing which
indicates when the data will be broadcast and its position in the
broadcast. Access latency and tuning time are the two main
parameters which may be used to evaluate an indexing scheme.
Two of the important indexing schemes proposed earlier were tree
based and the exponential indexing schemes. None of these
schemes were able to address the requirements of location
dependent data (LDD) which is highly desirable feature of data
dissemination. In this paper, we discuss the broadcast of LDD in
our project DAta in Your Space (DAYS), and propose a scheme
for indexing LDD. We argue that this scheme, when applied to
LDD, significantly improves performance in terms of tuning time
over the above mentioned schemes. We prove our argument with
the help of simulation results.

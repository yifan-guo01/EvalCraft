ABSTRACT
Recommender systems aggregate individual user ratings into
predictions of products or services that might interest 
visitors. The quality of this aggregation process crucially 
affects the user experience and hence the effectiveness of 
recommenders in e-commerce. We present a novel study that
disaggregates global recommender performance metrics into
contributions made by each individual rating, allowing us
to characterize the many roles played by ratings in 
nearestneighbor collaborative filtering. In particular, we formulate
three roles-scouts, promoters, and connectors-that 
capture how users receive recommendations, how items get 
recommended, and how ratings of these two types are 
themselves connected (resp.). These roles find direct uses in 
improving recommendations for users, in better targeting of
items and, most importantly, in helping monitor the health
of the system as a whole. For instance, they can be used
to track the evolution of neighborhoods, to identify rating
subspaces that do not contribute (or contribute negatively)
to system performance, to enumerate users who are in 
danger of leaving, and to assess the susceptibility of the system
to attacks such as shilling. We argue that the three rating
roles presented here provide broad primitives to manage a
recommender system and its community.

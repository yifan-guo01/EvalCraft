ABSTRACT
We investigate the class of single-round, sealed-bid auctions for a
set of identical items to bidders who each desire one unit. We adopt
the worst-case competitive framework defined by [9, 5] that 
compares the profit of an auction to that of an optimal single-price sale
of least two items. In this paper, we first derive an optimal auction
for three items, answering an open question from [8]. Second, we
show that the form of this auction is independent of the 
competitive framework used. Third, we propose a schema for converting
a given limited-supply auction into an unlimited supply auction.
Applying this technique to our optimal auction for three items, we
achieve an auction with a competitive ratio of 3.25, which improves
upon the previously best-known competitive ratio of 3.39 from [7].
Finally, we generalize a result from [8] and extend our 
understanding of the nature of the optimal competitive auction by showing that
the optimal competitive auction occasionally offers prices that are
higher than all bid values.

ABSTRACT
Research in Information Retrieval usually shows performance
improvement when many sources of evidence are combined
to produce a ranking of documents (e.g., texts, pictures,
sounds, etc.). In this paper, we focus on the rank aggregation
problem, also called data fusion problem, where rankings of
documents, searched into the same collection and provided
by multiple methods, are combined in order to produce a
new ranking. In this context, we propose a rank aggregation
method within a multiple criteria framework using 
aggregation mechanisms based on decision rules identifying positive
and negative reasons for judging whether a document should
get a better rank than another. We show that the proposed
method deals well with the Information Retrieval distinctive
features. Experimental results are reported showing that
the suggested method performs better than the well-known
CombSUM and CombMNZ operators.

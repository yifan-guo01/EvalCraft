ABSTRACT
In many sensor networks, data or events are named by 
attributes. Many of these attributes have scalar values, so one
natural way to query events of interest is to use a 
multidimensional range query. An example is: List all events
whose temperature lies between 50◦
and 60◦
, and whose
light levels lie between 10 and 15. Such queries are useful
for correlating events occurring within the network.
In this paper, we describe the design of a distributed 
index that scalably supports multi-dimensional range queries.
Our distributed index for multi-dimensional data (or DIM)
uses a novel geographic embedding of a classical index data
structure, and is built upon the GPSR geographic routing
algorithm. Our analysis reveals that, under reasonable 
assumptions about query distributions, DIMs scale quite well
with network size (both insertion and query costs scale as
O(
√
N)). In detailed simulations, we show that in practice,
the insertion and query costs of other alternatives are 
sometimes an order of magnitude more than the costs of DIMs,
even for moderately sized network. Finally, experiments on
a small scale testbed validate the feasibility of DIMs.

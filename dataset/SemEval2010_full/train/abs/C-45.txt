Abstract
The problem of localization in wireless sensor networks
where nodes do not use ranging hardware, remains a 
challenging problem, when considering the required location 
accuracy, energy expenditure and the duration of the 
localization phase. In this paper we propose a framework, called
StarDust, for wireless sensor network localization based on
passive optical components. In the StarDust framework,
sensor nodes are equipped with optical retro-reflectors. An
aerial device projects light towards the deployed sensor 
network, and records an image of the reflected light. An image
processing algorithm is developed for obtaining the locations
of sensor nodes. For matching a node ID to a location we
propose a constraint-based label relaxation algorithm. We
propose and develop localization techniques based on four
types of constraints: node color, neighbor information, 
deployment time for a node and deployment location for a
node. We evaluate the performance of a localization system
based on our framework by localizing a network of 26 
sensor nodes deployed in a 120 × 60 ft2 area. The localization
accuracy ranges from 2 ft to 5 ft while the localization time
ranges from 10 milliseconds to 2 minutes.

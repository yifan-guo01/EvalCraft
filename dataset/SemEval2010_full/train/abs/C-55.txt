ABSTRACT
In this paper, we present an implemented system for supporting
group interaction in mobile distributed computing environments.
First, an introduction to context computing and a motivation for
using contextual information to facilitate group interaction is
given. We then present the architecture of our system, which
consists of two parts: a subsystem for location sensing that
acquires information about the location of users as well as spatial
proximities between them, and one for the actual context-aware
application, which provides services for group interaction.

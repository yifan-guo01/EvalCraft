ABSTRACT
We are interested in retrieving information from speech data
like broadcast news, telephone conversations and roundtable
meetings. Today, most systems use large vocabulary 
continuous speech recognition tools to produce word transcripts;
the transcripts are indexed and query terms are retrieved
from the index. However, query terms that are not part
of the recognizer"s vocabulary cannot be retrieved, and the
recall of the search is affected. In addition to the output
word transcript, advanced systems provide also phonetic
transcripts, against which query terms can be matched 
phonetically. Such phonetic transcripts suffer from lower 
accuracy and cannot be an alternative to word transcripts.
We present a vocabulary independent system that can 
handle arbitrary queries, exploiting the information provided
by having both word transcripts and phonetic transcripts.
A speech recognizer generates word confusion networks and
phonetic lattices. The transcripts are indexed for query 
processing and ranking purpose. The value of the proposed
method is demonstrated by the relative high performance of
our system, which received the highest overall ranking for
US English speech data in the recent NIST Spoken Term
Detection evaluation [1].

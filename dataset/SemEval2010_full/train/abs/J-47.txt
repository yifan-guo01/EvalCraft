ABSTRACT
We embark on a systematic analysis of the power and 
limitations of iterative combinatorial auctions. Most existing
iterative combinatorial auctions are based on repeatedly 
suggesting prices for bundles of items, and querying the bidders
for their demand under these prices. We prove a large
number of results showing the boundaries of what can be
achieved by auctions of this kind. We first focus on auctions
that use a polynomial number of demand queries, and then
we analyze the power of different kinds of ascending-price
auctions.

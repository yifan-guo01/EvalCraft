ABSTRACT
We present an analysis of a person-to-person 
recommendation network, consisting of 4 million people who made 16
million recommendations on half a million products. We
observe the propagation of recommendations and the 
cascade sizes, which we explain by a simple stochastic model.
We then establish how the recommendation network grows
over time and how effective it is from the viewpoint of the
sender and receiver of the recommendations. While on 
average recommendations are not very effective at inducing
purchases and do not spread very far, we present a model
that successfully identifies product and pricing categories for
which viral marketing seems to be very effective.

ABSTRACT
This paper describes the design, implementation and 
evaluation of a search and rescue system called CenWits. CenWits
uses several small, commonly-available RF-based sensors,
and a small number of storage and processing devices. It is
designed for search and rescue of people in emergency 
situations in wilderness areas. A key feature of CenWits is that
it does not require a continuously connected sensor network
for its operation. It is designed for an intermittently 
connected network that provides only occasional connectivity.
It makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability
of sensors to filter, organize and store important 
information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the
system remains operational for longer time periods, and 
intermittent network connectivity to propagate information
to a processing center. A prototype of CenWits has been
implemented using Berkeley Mica2 motes. The paper 
describes this implementation and reports on the performance
measured from it.

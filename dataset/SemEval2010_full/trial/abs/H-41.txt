ABSTRACT
This paper describes a large-scale evaluation of the 
effectiveness of HITS in comparison with other link-based 
ranking algorithms, when used in combination with a 
state-ofthe-art text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text. We
quantified their effectiveness using three common 
performance measures: the mean reciprocal rank, the mean 
average precision, and the normalized discounted cumulative
gain measurements. The evaluation is based on two large
data sets: a breadth-first search crawl of 463 million web
pages containing 17.6 billion hyperlinks and referencing 2.9
billion distinct URLs; and a set of 28,043 queries sampled
from a query log, each query having on average 2,383 
results, about 17 of which were labeled by judges. We found
that HITS outperforms PageRank, but is about as 
effective as web-page in-degree. The same holds true when any
of the link-based features are combined with the text 
retrieval algorithm. Finally, we studied the relationship 
between query specificity and the effectiveness of selected 
features, and found that link-based features perform better for
general queries, whereas BM25F performs better for specific
queries.

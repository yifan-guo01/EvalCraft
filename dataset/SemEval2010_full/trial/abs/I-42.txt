ABSTRACT
Distributed Constraint Optimization (DCOP) is a general 
framework that can model complex problems in multi-agent systems.
Several current algorithms that solve general DCOP instances, 
including ADOPT and DPOP, arrange agents into a traditional 
pseudotree structure. We introduce an extension to the DPOP algorithm
that handles an extended set of pseudotree arrangements. Our 
algorithm correctly solves DCOP instances for pseudotrees that 
include edges between nodes in separate branches. The algorithm
also solves instances with traditional pseudotree arrangements 
using the same procedure as DPOP.
We compare our algorithm with DPOP using several metrics 
including the induced width of the pseudotrees, the maximum 
dimensionality of messages and computation, and the maximum 
sequential path cost through the algorithm. We prove that for some 
problem instances it is not possible to generate a traditional pseudotree
using edge-traversal heuristics that will outperform a cross-edged
pseudotree. We use multiple heuristics to generate pseudotrees and
choose the best pseudotree in linear space-time complexity. For
some problem instances we observe significant improvements in
message and computation sizes compared to DPOP.

ABSTRACT
Finding an equilibrium of an extensive form game of 
imperfect information is a fundamental problem in computational
game theory, but current techniques do not scale to large
games. To address this, we introduce the ordered game 
isomorphism and the related ordered game isomorphic 
abstraction transformation. For a multi-player sequential game of
imperfect information with observable actions and an 
ordered signal space, we prove that any Nash equilibrium in
an abstracted smaller game, obtained by one or more 
applications of the transformation, can be easily converted into
a Nash equilibrium in the original game. We present an 
algorithm, GameShrink, for abstracting the game using our
isomorphism exhaustively. Its complexity is ˜O(n2
), where n
is the number of nodes in a structure we call the signal tree.
It is no larger than the game tree, and on nontrivial games
it is drastically smaller, so GameShrink has time and space
complexity sublinear in the size of the game tree. Using
GameShrink, we find an equilibrium to a poker game with
3.1 billion nodes-over four orders of magnitude more than
in the largest poker game solved previously. We discuss
several electronic commerce applications for GameShrink.
To address even larger games, we introduce approximation
methods that do not preserve equilibrium, but nevertheless
yield (ex post) provably close-to-optimal strategies.

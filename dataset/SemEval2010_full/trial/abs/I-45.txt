ABSTRACT
Although agent interaction plays a vital role in MAS, and 
messagecentric approaches to agent interaction have their drawbacks, present
agent-oriented programming languages do not provide support for
implementing agent interaction that is flexible and robust. Instead,
messages are provided as a primitive building block. In this 
paper we consider one approach for modelling agent interactions: the
commitment machines framework. This framework supports 
modelling interactions at a higher level (using social commitments), 
resulting in more flexible interactions. We investigate how 
commitmentbased interactions can be implemented in conventional agent-oriented
programming languages. The contributions of this paper are: a
mapping from a commitment machine to a collection of BDI-style
plans; extensions to the semantics of BDI programming languages;
and an examination of two issues that arise when distributing 
commitment machines (turn management and race conditions) and 
solutions to these problems.
